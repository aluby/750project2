a leading picasso scholar says that hundreds of paintings and drawings made by the artist during the #s were inspired by an infatuation with the american socialite and jazz age luminary sara murphy and are not as has long been thought idealized figures or depictions of the woman who was picassos wife at the time olga among the works is the neo classical masterpiece woman in white at the metropolitan museum of art the assertion that some kind of romance took place between picasso and sara murphy is made by william rubin the picasso scholar and former head of the department of painting and sculpture at the museum of modern art in the pipes of pan picassos aborted love song to sara murphy an article to be published in the may issue of the magazine art news confronting some several hundred images many of them patently romantic it was hard to avoid concluding that picasso was mesmerized by sara indeed enamored of her mr rubin writes he believes madame picasso a work in the national gallery in washington that christian zervos the author of the complete catalogue of picassos art once identified as a portrait of olga actually depicts sara moreover he says the monumental painting the pipes of pan in the musee picasso in paris a work that depicts two young males began as a four figure composition that included sara in the role of venus and the artist himself in the role of mars but that her rejection of him caused picasso to eliminate sara from it new infrared photographs of the painting he writes support his conclusion that the composition began with a figure of venus and changed radically secret side to a public life picasso is so well known yet there is clearly a part of his life and work that he kept secret and that he lied about to interviewers mr rubin said recently in an interview in his office at the modern picasso possibly misdated works depicting sara to throw people specifically his wife off the track said mr rubin by going through picassos vast output between # when picasso met sara and # shortly after the infatuation ended mr rubin said he can now associate hundreds of works with her many of these associations are hard to see however because picasso tended to stylize or idealize his depictions and sometimes blended portraits of different women into one yet mr rubin insisted that after countless hours of looking at these works in preparing an exhibition of picasso portraits he is organizing at the modern for # he has little doubt that they represent sara he writes in the article that the picasso authority pierre daix was long ago told in confidence by the artist that a painting from # was a portrait of sara and that honoria donnelly the murphys daughter has known the same thing about certain drawings but previously no one mr rubin states suspected the existence of the almost # oil paintings nor the more than # drawings of sara that we can now identify indeed he continues in # pictures of sara far outnumber those of picassos wife olga the summer of # gerald and sara murphy were famous jazz age figures they were the models for dick and nicole diver in f scott fitzgeralds novel tender is the night they lived at the hotel du cap just outside antibes france in the summer of # when picasso was also there gerald murphy had been trained as a landscape architect at harvard then had studied with the russian painter natalya goncharova as had sara it was while they were helping to repair scenery at the ballets russes in paris in # at goncharovas behest that picasso may have first met sara gerald became a precisionist painter along the lines of charles sheeler and charles demuth whose proto pop depictions of consumer goods included products manufactured by the mark cross saddlery and design company which his father owned in the #s gerald returned to the united states and took over the business he also collaborated with cole porter on the ballet within the quota a relationship mr rubin hints may have been homosexual mr rubin suggests in the art news article a scenario in which picasso used his considerable animal magnetism to woo sara in antibes during the summer of # when gerald retreated to be with porter in venice mr rubin stops short of claiming that the serious flirtation between sara and picasso escalated into sex in conversation however he is more inclined than he is in the article to imagine a romance i dont know for a fact that anything happened he said but my feeling increasingly is that it was a brief thing probably but that it did happen if she needed any rationale it didnt hurt that her husband was off with cole porter in venice while picasso was courting her hypotheses convincing the writer calvin tomkins whose book living well is the best revenge recounts the lives of the murphys said in a telephone interview that he finds mr rubins hypotheses on the whole convincing but he added i doubt if it was a romance picasso was seeing a lot of the murphys that particular summer and he was very susceptible to beautiful women as we know sara was a woman a lot of men fell in love with including fitzgerald maybe hemingway too i would imagine that she was more or less unaware of picassos infatuation or very skillful at keeping it within bounds mr tompkins did agree with mr rubin about the identity of sara in picassos art i just went to see the woman in white the other day and you can certainly see sara in the portrait he said john richardson the picasso biographer also agreed with mr rubins analysis he noted that in # in arts magazine two art historians robert judson clark and marian burleigh motley identified the source of the final version of pipes of pan as a homoerotic photograph from # by baron wilhelm von gloeden which mr richardson said makes an interesting potential allusion to gerald and cole porter mr rubin when pointed to the # article said it added another piece to the puzzle of what he is calling the four cornered triangle of the murphys picasso and porter the whole scenario has even led mr rubin hardly a pop culture sort ordinarily to wonder whether there might be a movie in it the team of merchant and ivory is already doing a picasso film he discovered based on the memoirs of francoise gilot still mr rubin has got in touch with andrew wylie mr tomkinss literary agent who is shopping the idea around im talking to people was all mr wylie would say when pablo met sara anyone
