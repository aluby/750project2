in a china that is rushing wildly toward its own idea of economic development obliterating a good deal of its remaining cultural heritage in the process some chinese artists have found an unusual way of expressing dissent they have begun looking backward hoping that nostalgia can serve as a mirror to remind the country that it has a past yet it is a measure of how quickly china is changing that this past may be as recent as two decades ago it is also a past that in some ways is being romanticized not to approve of what may have happened or to suggest that things were better then but simply to recall that there is more to china than the current feverish drive for profits that at least is the premise of reckoning with the past an intriguing exhibition of # works by # chinese artists # from china and # each from taiwan and hong kong at the fruitmarket gallery here the show which provides a rare window for the west on contemporary chinese art closes on saturday but it will travel successively to aberdeen ayr and kirkcaldy in scotland through next june and then tour other european cities for # months contemporary artists interest in the past implies a questioning of chinas legacy of modernity chang tsong zung a hong kong based curator and expert in chinese art wrote in the exhibitions catalogue their nostalgia points to a yearning for symbols which rise above the vagaries of temporal political and economic forces perhaps most surprising is the reappearance of mao zedong as a kind of pop art icon portrayed in two paintings by yu youhan in a flowery mao suit floating over assembled students and red guards more ironically wang xingwei has taken maos place in various heroic poses against mountainous landscapes all evidently inspired by liu chunhuas famous propaganda portrait chairman mao goes to an yuan feng mengo a # year old artist from beijing has found an even more unusual way of transforming the past creating colorful video game images of a red guard called wang kick fighting a blond american called guile in the process he both trivializes and immortalizes the anti american hysteria of the cultural revolution which he is of course too young to remember graeme murray the fruitmarket gallerys director readily admits that it is difficult to generalize about chinese art today above all because there is no conventional art market in china itself each of chinas # provinces has a fine arts academy but there are few private galleries or collectors and the chinese press gives scant attention to the visual arts mr murray said that he and mr chang who organized the show together were nonetheless free to travel around china in search of talent shows tend to be held in private homes art schools or hotel lobbies he said but we picked our own artists and no one gave us any trouble with this show the fruitmarket gallery is continuing its series of exhibitions dedicated to asia it presented liquid crystal futures a show of contemporary japanese photography in # and information and reality contemporary korean art in # the gallerys summer show next year timed to coincide with the edinburgh international festival will have contemporary indian art as its theme what distinguishes reckoning with the past from other albeit very occasional group shows of chinese art is that it embraces artists from taiwan and hong kong as well as china and while the artists from these three chinas are the products of very different modern histories the decision to unite them seems justified by their common search for identity at a time of convulsive change including the prospect of hong kongs reversion to chinas control next year although the paintings and drawings on display here are figurative suggesting an urgency to communicate the artists seem to have different concerns chinas artists while dealing with personal experiences cannot avoid addressing the public sphere mr chang said for the artists from taiwan and hong kong there is a much more individualistic quest for identity and belonging certainly there is a dreamlike quality to some of the work from taiwan and hong kong in contrast chinas artists face both political constraints and the legacy of a #th century in which the country has repeatedly rejected its past starting with the fall of the last imperial dynasty in # and continuing with the communist revolution of # the cultural revolution of # to # and the economic revolution of the past decade mr chang said that during the cultural revolution unthinkable quantities of historical artifacts were destroyed and mao succeeded in severing any physical and sentimental ties china might have with its own history but todays economic drive has also been catastrophic he said with ancient towns being wiped out by the three gorges dam project on the yangtze river and historic architecture being razed by rapid urbanization no less alarming though is the apparent public indifference to what is now happening an apathy that mr chang attributes to the average citizens alienation from his own past in this sense then by trying to recreate the past in their own terms the countrys artists are making a strong statement about chinas direction today zhang xiaogang a # year old painter working in chongqing has focused on the legacy of collectivism through a series of photographlike portraits called bloodline and comrades in these the subjects stare out of the canvas conveying no visible emotion yet each has a stain on his or her face suggesting an inner wound the first lesson we have to learn is to protect ourselves and keep our experiences locked up in an inner chamber away from the prying of others mr zhang explained in a note in the catalogue different echoes of the past can be found in he duolings romantic portraits of early #th century chinese women in mao lizis pictures of vandalized ancient chinese images and in yang yipings oils of solitary men including red guard in slumber which was painted in # liu dahong has gone even further using surrealist images to recreate the ebullience of life in pre communist shanghai some artists from taiwan and hong kong in contrast seem to be trying to capture a more mythical china yu peng of taiwan has evoked ancient silk screens by painting traditional mountainous scenes peopled with strange figures lucia cheung from hong kong has blended the old and new more literally with green forest showing hong kongs skyscrapers peeping through bamboo trees yet for all the nostalgia evident in this show many of the artists insist that their purpose is to look to the future i hope that when people see my paintings they can dream of a better world than i have depicted said wei dong a beijing based artist who has placed women engaged in sadomasochistic activities in a traditional chinese landscape mr liu is even more optimistic my feeling he wrote is that as china is again breathing the air of freedom cultural revival will once more blossom in this ancient country
