eight year old molly testwuide a third grader at the brookside elementary school here carries a camera around with her most of the time she takes pictures in unlikely places shopping in the limited store in manhattan recently with her mother julie betts testwuide a professional artist and photographer and her sister emily # she said i looked up because i was bored all of a sudden i saw a round staircase she snapped it and the result is an abstract image that resembles the geometric intricacies of a giant seashell she achieved this effect by smearing a wet polaroid image with a wooden tool and coloring over it with pastels and colored pencils a process called polaroid manipulation taught to her by her mother mother and daughter will both be exhibiting what they call painterly photographs at the new century artists gallery in soho in manhattan through jan # ms testwuide and molly use several methods to achieve the impressionistic effect that makes their photographs look like paintings by monet or pissarro through experimentation ms testwuide has come up with a process that allows her to create effects that depart sharply from the original photograph the photographs in the show were taken with an old polaroid from the #s or #s ms testwuide said this camera uses the only film that works for our process before the image dries we use wooden tools such as cuticle sticks to manipulate the emulsion to an abstract image we then reprint it and enlarge it onto watercolor paper and take it to the next step with colored pencils and pastels the process is very new i learned it was possible in a polaroid workshop in the city and i took off from there i dont like color photos they look too real too now ive spent years trying to change photos and have them look more painterly looking over her photographs a photographer friend said to ms testwuide who has worked in corporate and sports photography photographed the new york marathon from the highest point of the scaffolding on the verrazano narrows bridge and who is also a professional childrens photographer i didnt know you did paintings too this pleased her she said adding i want people to have to look closely to see if the image is a painting or a photo im an old fashioned girl i aim for a timeless quality in my work i want people to wonder if the picture were taken # years ago or today many of her childrens photographs have a dreamy quality i have a closetful of soft creamy dresses for the girls to wear so as to focus on their face and eyes manipulating photographs wakes you up to seeing things differently ms testwuide said molly added you see it like you want to see it and then what we do with it is kind of a secret in a self portrait walking under trees where the shot was taken with a tripod and a timer ms testwuide used infrared film with a red filter to make the leaves white and then painted over it with transparent oils in a self portrait of herself twirling which molly set up and her mother clicked molly manipulated the emulsion on a wet print then covered the reprinted image with the shimmering colors of frances cote dazur both mother and daughter say they are absorbed by the creative process although molly hastened to add i also play the piano take dance class or i like to play with my cat nicky or play football with my dad my mom usually stays home from all that stuff shes usually working on her photos on a family trip to france this summer ms testwuide her two daughters and son kacey # took pictures constantly their subjects were the riviera and giverny monets home outside paris as well as the vineyards in bordeaux ms testwuides husband kip testwuide an investment banker said can we please have one dinner without photos nevertheless ms testwuide is almost obsessed with photographing wherever she goes in their #

year old son is the busiest artist of them all he wont let me throw out any boxes he goes to the garbage and pulls out corks he is busy all afternoon every day making his sculptures and uses anything he can get his hands on he is taken with tape and wont use glue an elaborate tunnel for his ninja turtles is made of boxes and balsa wood and sits in his room my kids find great satisfaction in creating a final product they can savor and save ms testwuide said its not like a store bought toy you just put back in the closet a photography studio gallery and darkroom are on a lower floor my mom knows all the tricks and she has taught me some of them molly said her mother was mouthing mollys words as she spoke molly laughed and said to her mother did you know you were saying just what i was saying in addition to the mother daughter show in soho this month ms testwuide will be exhibiting her work next month at the salmagundi club in manhattan and at lyndhurst in tarrytown the number to call for information is #
