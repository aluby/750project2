members of the landmarks preservation commission suggested at a public hearing yesterday that the whitney museum of american art had so far failed to persuade them of the need to demolish two madison avenue brownstones to make way for a museum expansion designed by the architect renzo piano when we are being asked to demolish a historic building i think we should be shown that it is really necessary for the programmatic function not just a design function roberta brandes gratz a commission member said the whitney she added doesnt seem to be making a compelling case for the loss mr pianos design includes a # foot tower that would rise behind a row of six brownstones next to the whitneys current # marcel breuer building on madison avenue and connect to the original with a series of glass bridges the design would require razing two of the brownstones to make way for a new # foot wide entrance that would lead to a public piazza the new entrance is to be used for the general public and the original one for school groups the commission called the hearings because the buildings that would be razed lie within the protected upper east side historic district one of those brownstones two doors to the right of the breuer is a so called contributing building one that has been deemed to be of artistic historic or cultural importance approval of the whitney plan would mark the first time that the commission had issued a certificate of appropriateness allowing the demolition of a contributing brownstone in a historic district robert b tierney the chairman of the commission said that another public meeting would be held in the next few weeks before the commission votes on whether to approve the expansion ms gratz suggested that the whitney seek an alternative plan that would preserve the entire street front of brownstones and have visitors pass through one of them to enter the museum visibly agitated mr piano countered that retaining the brownstones would undermine the essential notion of his design which is to open the whitney to the street and invite people into the piazza im a bit at a loss he said how can you make a piazza create a sense of connection if you have to enter through a shop window its not going to work he said you need somebody who will invent something else because i dont see how to solve the problem mr piano also argued that retaining the brownstones would disrupt the balance between the breuer building the brownstones and his new nine story addition making the new tower essentially disappear the exchange suggested that the whitney faces a tougher battle than it had expected in gaining the commissions approval for the design the third expansion plan it has commissioned since the #s the museum previously abandoned two other plans one by michael graves and another by rem koolhaas the whitney addition would give the cramped museum more space to display its collection and to provide education programs members of the commission questioned the advisability of creating a second entrance suggesting that the new one would compete with the old one im concerned that the iconographic entrance will be a relic that will not be functional pablo e vengoechea the commissions vice chairman said of the breuer entrance rather than building a new entrance christopher moore another commission member asked whether adjustments could be made to the original to better accommodate crowds im not convinced you really have explained how to make the breuer entrance useful he said adam d weinberg the director of the museum said that the breuer entrance roughly six feet wide was routinely congested by the mix of large school groups and the general public and that he did not feel the new entrance would undermine the original i dont think people are going to say gee this one is the busy entrance and this is the lonely entrance he said when mr piano first drafted plans for the whitneys two entrances mr weinberg said he drew an apple and a pear side by side with a space between them the idea was let breuer be breuer mr weinberg said it doesnt lessen one or the other it just gives them two different functions it lets the apple be the apple and the pear be the pear mr pianos current projects in manhattan also include a new building for the new york times company an expansion of the columbia university campus and an addition to the pierpont morgan library
