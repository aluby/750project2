a lot of the most radical art of the #s and #s never made it into museums or did so only in residue form like swept up confetti after a party this was certainly true of art based on actions and interactions rather than on objects a thing of beauty may be a joy forever but a beautiful gesture did you see it no too late its gone tropic lia a revolution in brazilian culture at the bronx museum of the arts is an absorbing if inevitably diffuse attempt to recapture such a fugitive art one that flourished for a mere five years from # to # tropic lia or tropicalism wasnt a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere a rush of youthful cosmopolitan liberationist optimism that broke over brazil like a sun shower and soaked into everything art music fashion film theater literature almost instantly it gave rise to a crop of startling hybrids american psychedelic rock cross pollinating sambas political resistance with the pleasure principle brazilian art with international art the new growth was dense and enveloping you looked at it listened to it tasted it breathed in its perfume lived in it or you didnt in which case the whole phenomenon was puzzling at best and threatening at worst to the military authorities then in power it was a clear and present danger they let the party go on for a while then clamped down hard by # tropic lia was effectively over leaving scraps of itself photographs films recordings manifestoes and fragile pieces of art behind the show organized by carlos basualdo a curator at the philadelphia museum of art is largely made up of such scraps in historical exhibitions this could be a serious liability you would be getting only a fragmented view of a larger whole but even at its peak tropic lia was a thing of many parts some of which like art and pop music connected only obliquely it brought global and brazilian culture together in barely digested combinations politically it was oppositional without being ideological or rather it embraced many ideologies the name tropic lia actually derived from art specifically from a single work by h lio oiticica # # a leading figure of the brazilian avant garde he was born into a family of leftist intellectuals in rio de janeiro and went to school there in the #s with a group of remarkable contemporaries among them lygia clark and lygia pape who are major presences in the bronx show although mr oiticicas main work at the time was utopian mondrian inspired abstract painting he also experimented with ephemeral materials and tactile forms in # he started attending a samba school in one of rios favelas or shantytowns and his immersion in this performance based popular art transformed his work he turned his attention from making gallery bound objects to environments for viewer participation plain and practical in design but with certain brazilian elements added the result was an exoticized sensorily stimulating walk in version of modernist abstraction when he exhibited the first of these ramshackle funky constructions publicly in # he titled it tropic lia a reproduction of that piece complete with live plants and parrots enclosures modeled on favela architecture and a single television blasting away is the centerpiece of the bronx show where it melds into a second oiticica piece the eden plan # # equipped with a wading pool nests of dried leaves and a tent with piped in music mr oiticica was explicit about the music to be played songs by gilberto gil and caetano veloso two of the countrys hottest young music stars the dreamboaty mr veloso was especially popular in # in a bow to mr oiticica he titled an album tropic lia and in the process he gave the name to an intense moment of brazilian pop culture many people associate tropic lia exclusively with the music which combined bossa nova euro american pop and traditional brazilian material woven around anti establishment lyrics its fabulous stuff and you can get a concentrated dose of it in a series of video clips playing in the bronx museums handsome new architectural extension among the clips are shots of mr gil and mr veloso singing to enraptured crowds and tropicalist fellow travelers like the former bossa nova stylist gal costa dressed like little richard and sounding like janis joplin and the band os mutantes nearby is a selection of flower powerish album covers and a lavish display of tropic lia fashions made of fabrics printed with tropical flowers birds and vibrant abstract patterns the clothes perfectly embody the marriage of op pop and braziliana that mr oiticica envisioned these are remnants of a classic #s scene and as in everything #s tensions buzzed away under the surface despite or because of its popularity tropic lia drew fire from both ends of the political spectrum to the left its commercial success was deeply suspect and its espousal of hedonism joy joy was the title of one of mr velosos hit songs as a mode of subversion regressive mr oiticica shared these concerns for the right the matter was simpler tropic lia was part of an international revolutionary impulse and it had to go in # mr gil and mr veloso played some gigs at a nightclub where there was a banner designed by mr oiticica with the words be an outlaw be a hero soon after they were jailed and then went into exile mr oiticica also left tropic lia was over or at least it was subdued mr oiticica who moved to new york continued to think and write about it he was and remains its real theoretician mr veloso an international celebrity has tended to smooth over tropic lias sharper edges while keeping its spirit alive mr gil the current minister of culture in brazil periodically invokes it as a political model while remaining ambiguous about how its politics were defined they were defined of course by ambiguity a refusal of dogmatism that ideally opened the path for a carnivalesque collective activism one that has parallels in certain interventionist political art today the show addresses the question of tropic lias continuing influence by including work by several young artists made in response to it a stick on mural of classic tropicalist images orchestrated by the brazilian born artist assume vivid astro focus generates a celebratory energy but pieces by two young artists based in brazil rodrigo araujo and marcos reis peixoto who goes by the name marepe allude to continuing social inequities that tropicalism never addressed in the end it is mr oiticicas work that seems particularly in a museum context most radical and most alive for one thing it is there but not there almost everything under his name in the show is a reproduction of an original either fragile beyond use or gone for another his is truly an art of gestures not frozen in time but repeated and translated differently by each visitor who walks into his tropic lia environment and makes it his or her own if we engage with his art it is something if we do not it is nothing its creation is our responsibility tropic lia a revolution in brazilian culture runs through jan #
