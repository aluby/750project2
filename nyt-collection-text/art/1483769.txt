gagosian gallery # west #th street chelsea through may # jenny savilles plus size expressionistic pictures of naked corpulent female bodies have given figurative painting a good shot in the arm this # year old london artist has tended to hedge her bets by means of abstraction here in a full figure self portrait the rude effect of the spread eagled forward thrusting naked pelvis is mitigated by cubist fragmentation produced by mirrors surrounding the figure with her five other canvases ms saville shifts into melodramatic overdrive two paintings frame the artists head lying on its side like a big boulder one in dank shades of bluish gray looks like the head of a corpse the other in reds and tans depicts her with glistening eyes and open bruised mouth as though resting from a domestic beating derived from photographs these paintings have a vivid illusionism that the painterly action simultaneously abstracts and enhances slashing smearing staining and drizzling the artist conjures a desperate mood its as though the paintings were made from the artists own bodily fluids these works are not exactly funny but the sensational hyperbole borders on comedy a huge # foot wide picture of a dead pigs body painted in bloody red suggests a move away from the clinical realism of lucian freud toward the seriocomic horror of francis bacon a picture of a screaming woman her face seemingly bathed in blood might be an homage to his screaming pope ms savilles paintings lend themselves to feminist interpretation but what is more interesting is the fraught relationship between the macho formal dimensions and the content of brutalized femininity ken johnson art in review
