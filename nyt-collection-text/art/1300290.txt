when jonathan larson first performed the show that was to become tick tick boom on may # # he had been struggling for eight years to establish a career in the theater workshops of superbia the futuristic rock musical he had spent five years writing had recently failed to attract backers for a full production hoping he might have better luck with something smaller and cheaper to produce he devised a new solo vehicle he called it # # he had just turned # and the piece that the small group assembled in his agents office heard that may # was autobiographical and angry reflecting jonathans frustration at not getting ahead with the work he was so devoted to it also signaled his anxiety about leaving his #s behind more birthdays came and went before he performed the retitled tick tick boom in front of a paying audience at new york theater workshop in # by then the piece had developed into a hybrid part performance art monologue part rock recital it was also judging from existing tapes tough to perform jonathan had to execute long bogosian style monologues often playing several characters and sing musical numbers that themselves often represented multiple points of view all the while accompanying himself on the piano and directing the band that accompanied him he never quite resolved all the problems and that is reflected in the scripts that survive there are at least five versions and a variety of song lists in time he came to feel that his energy might be better spent on a full scale show after all and he turned his attention to rent which was in part a fictionalization and expansion of many of the themes in tick tick boom jonathan of course did not live to experience the enormous success of rent or the fulfillment of the hopes he expressed so fervently in his monologue he died of an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm on jan # # at the age of # last october the producers victoria leacock a longtime friend of jonathans and robyn goodman who had worked with him on his early versions of tick tick boom began meeting with the larson family about reviving the show ms leacock and ms goodman first recruited the director scott schwartz who proposed remaking the show as a three hander with one actor playing jonathan and two others taking the multiple roles including those of jonathans girlfriend susan and his best friend michael ms goodman who knew me from my work on proof asked me to look at the scripts i had never met jonathan and i had concerns about working from his unproduced drafts but i found all the material vivid funny and rich and the music erased any doubts as one listen made clear this was not a collection of leftovers or b side material but a complete score of first rate songs they were more self contained than those in the sung through rent but equally strong and anchored to a clear story line the musical director stephen oremus began rearranging the songs for three voices my job was to perform an analogous task with the monologue sections so that the character of jonathan could interact with those the author used to play himself the larger effort was an editorial one assembling a new performance version out of jonathans earlier drafts more difficult was deciding what to do with the thematic material as the title suggests tick tick boom is all about the fear of running out of time to succeed to be the artist and the person you want to be the monologues are full of warnings about selling out a danger that jonathan saw in terms so stark as to be occasionally puzzling even to his family and friends this motif might seem clich d or worse ironic without some knowledge of how truly devoted jonathan was to a highly romantic view of bohemia but since this comes across strongly in all his work including rent it clearly belonged in our tick tick boom most troubling jonathans drafts return obsessively to his terror of growing older to his feeling of being under so much pressure that his heart is about to burst in his chest given our retrospective knowledge of what happened to him how could these references seem anything but cruelly manipulative with the familys permission we cut almost all of them the final result in previews at the jane street theater where it opens on wednesday with ra l esparza who plays the character based on jonathan amy spanger and jerry dixon is not exactly the tick tick boom that jonathan envisioned but it is still very much his show the words and notes he wrote and played and because it is it gives audiences a chance to experience again in a new context the strengths of jonathans work his warmth his uncanny feel for the frustrations and pleasures of artists lives in the city his hard verbal wit and above all his songs which are living testaments to a melodic gift so fluent and euphoric that it seemed at least for a while to be endless theater david auburns play proof won the tony award and the pulitzer prize this year
