reality is tricky business just how tricky it can be when photographers get their hands on it is on display in two summer group shows architectural constructs in contemporary photography at the julie saul gallery in soho and alternative realities at the laurence miller gallery in midtown of the two architectural constructs gives a fuller sampling of postmodern staged or set up photography which gathered critical mass in the #s and #s and shows no signs of going away some stalwarts of this genre james casebere robert cumming and nic nicosia are represented here the models mr casebere has been creating for the camera are blank architectural scenes built out of paper cardboard and other materials his cerebral pristine images of patently unreal structures have spawned other deconstructivist work including that of bernard voita mr voita who is swiss also constructs small models in his studio but instead of taking sharp black and white pictures of his handiwork he produces blurry ones that have a lonely documentary cast an untitled # photograph here evokes train tracks a # image is seemingly of empty cribs a heavy ominous shadow in the foreground a model builder who is carrying mr caseberes deadpan views of everyday structures to new heights of make believe realism is oliver boberg a german whose work is also on view at the paul morris gallery in chelsea mr boberg is a painter as well and in his superbly realistic models of nondescript familiar structures apartment buildings roads underpasses stairways walls and canals he gives his illusions of the banal a surprisingly elegiac veneer postmodern staged photography has come a long way since the time mr cumming made his subtly subversive straw house # and mr nicosia his wackily subversive domestic drama no # # mr cumming photographed a skeletal house built with candy striped drinking straws the straw house sits on a tray filled to overflowing with sprinkles that resemble pills a mirror placed back of the house visually doubling the mess on top of a rough hewn wooden table in his characteristically cartoonish image mr nicosia shows a suburban couple standing on a floor size blueprint of their dream house and having a shouting match a child watches the fight but a workman resting against a wall ignores the ruckus as does a woman working at a drafting table mr nicosias set up is tame compared with some of the fiendishly complicated props and lights used by some artists before they took a single picture for her off kilter neo cubist architectural studies of the #s like the image of the whitney museum of american art at julie saul barbara kasten didnt just have on hand large custom made oval and geometric mirrors that she positioned with care to catch certain elements that would offset other aspects of a building also on hand were a lighting consultant electrical generators and a crew to handle the powerful lights fitted with colored gels that kasten used to paint vivid colors on building facades with its emphasis on cinematic splash the kasten image is a self conscious triumph of style over substance at first glance it seems this can also be said of the futuristic digital video which is accompanied by a set of five iris prints produced by hani rashid and lise anne couture canadian architects who work collaboratively as asymptote in manhattan their iscapes # # # an endlessly morphing digital work displayed on a small dvd player could be a delightful screen saver for the well heeled but even if it benefits from the allure of the new this mesmerizing work and its sleekly beautifully alien forms offers a glimpse of what it must have been like around # when horse and buggy folks were suddenly confronted with the machine age and the machine esthetic while julie saul emphasizes set up photography the laurence miller gallery shows more computer manipulated or computer generated images here some artists are clearly better at the computer than others the computer manipulated images by peter campus done in the early and mid #s and based on his own photographs of leaves and plants are too earnest exercises dennis farbers game boy # is overly familiar a boy is intent on shooting a marble near or perched on some of the marbles are miniature figures of two women in swimsuits and a schoolgirl all #s style mr faber may be trying for some postmodern camp surrealistic montages of this kind were a staple of the #s but he hasnt improved on this overworked genre similarly the alexandre castonguay head shots which the canadian artist created on his computer in # # by combining in each portrait the faces of several people essentially echo nancy bursons computer composites of the #s on the other hand the team known as aziz cucher has produced some of the most provocative and haunting computer generated images in their interior series # anthony aziz and sammy cucher who was found to have h i v in # have superimposed surfaces of the human body on architectural spaces for her postmodern series here maggie taylor scanned turn of the #th century cabinet portraits into her computer she obscured the subjects faces and gave them vaguely gothic overtly surreal props like a fancy shell for a skirt wings the color of kingfisher feathers or a bewigged rams head the results are enchanting turn of this century renderings of a fanciful past the most unnerving and brilliant computer manipulated images here are by margi geerlinks who is dutch her four color prints roughly # by # inches are spare and have a simple subject the creation of parts of a human body in an untitled work from # # a serene barefoot young woman in a simple white dress is knitting the tops of a woolen pair of pants but the wool covering a childs legs gives way to a childs feet in the three other photographs a man with tousled white hair and wearing a white shirt sits calmly at a sewing machine in one image a boy missing his lower torso is sprawled in front of the sewing machine in another a headless body is at the machine while the man appears to be on the verge of providing shoulders and a head in these pictures the young body to be worked on lies on a big white table the provider of body parts is bathed in a glowing white light with a minimum of fuss ms geerlinks seems to be making powerful allusions to breakthroughs in medical technology that allow for artificial insemination and the grafting back of severed limbs to the way people in the industrialized countries are going to plastic surgeons for new faces and new bodies and to the possible day in the future when human clones are harvested to replenish old or damaged or defective parts architectural constructs in contemporary photography is at the julie saul gallery #
