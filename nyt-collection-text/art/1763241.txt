they were painted in the #s and early #s by artists who are long forgotten on prime wall space in post offices schools and other public buildings across long island about # of the generously proportioned murals remain hiding in plain sight most of them in nassau county with widely varying degrees of artistic mastery the murals generally depict local history and contemporary scenes from the brooding and vaguely apocalyptic pleasures of the bathing beach in the lobby of the long beach post office painted by jon corbino in # to the far simpler and sunnier outdoor sports in the westhampton beach post office painted by sol wilson in # all of the paintings stem from depression era programs of the works progress administration later the works projects administration and the treasury department meant to employ artists in creating highly visible public art showing american life in the local settings where the works would be permanently displayed perhaps because the murals have been there so long many seem to have faded into the background people tend to become oblivious to them but they are right there in front of us said natalie a naylor of uniondale a retired professor and former director of the long island studies institute at hofstra university from # until # treasury department programs accounted for about # # murals in post offices throughout the country the postal service says about # # survive post offices in freeport garden city hempstead oyster bay port washington and rockville centre in addition to westhampton beach and long beach have one or more w p a murals some of long islands share of the #

feet by # feet appears to show slaves picking cotton in the antebellum south with a plantation mansion and a riverboat in the background the other mural is a wheat threshing scene all four murals are somewhat insensitively chopped on one side by fire barriers that were added later jonathan c gibralter the university president acknowledged that the murals were in jeopardy in the deteriorating buildings and said they were worth saving as historic artwork he said that two organizations alumni promoting horticulture programs in hicks hall and a private group planning to set up a sept # museum at cutler hall were trying to raise private money to renovate the buildings both built in # dr gibralter said he had been unable to secure state financing for renovations which would cost an estimated # million for each building he said an alternative would be to move the murals to the university library the university and the state department of parks recreation and historic restoration are discussing other steps to preserve the murals two other locked away murals bull smiths ride #
