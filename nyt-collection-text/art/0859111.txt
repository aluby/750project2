laura newman tenri cultural institute # broadway at prince street soho through july # laura newmans new paintings while still lacking in originality are a big improvement over her earlier landscapelike abstractions which often seemed forced and heavy handed the hints of landscapes remain but the pale colors and map like compositions suggest a realm high above the earth or that of the imagination a clear source is #s new image painting modified with a loose childlike rendering and with half buried feminist subject matter that seems pure #s one can imagine ms newman learning from such seemingly unrelated precedents as sue williams and dona nelson in phrenology crudely rendered circles topped off by weird blobs of color come to read as the heads of little girls with varying hairstyles in other paintings these heads drift across fields of scumbled color or in pearl river command a little red rocket evoking nancy the comic strip character in learning to draw fragments of the heads outlines suggest a kind of lexicon a not quite formed alphabet nearly everywhere the heads seem to function as crude signs of female psyche in formation meanwhile the paintings space is often animated by seemingly finger painted spirals of color that burrow across the surface like tunneling moles or the drawings of rebellious children these corral chunks of territory or sometimes as in totem frame a second vista of space like a number of women painting today ms newman seems intent on a kind of anecdotal or narrative abstraction that implies meaning without pinning it down this is sometimes weakened by a formal indecisiveness that can strike the eye as too self consciously unskilled but generally ms newman is aiming at a target much closer to home roberta smith
