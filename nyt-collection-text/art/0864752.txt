mellie cooper was getting ready to move the house was down to basics with all the collections and accessories that make a house a home packed and she was knee deep in preparation for a tag sale but calm prevailed for the artist who lives two organized lives one in fairfield not far from the southport harbor and the other on nantucket in her still intact third floor studio she was working toward an exhibition of paper reliefs called flags that opened last sunday at the janis aldridge gallery on nantucket ms cooper will be moving after what is expected to be a lengthy renovation into a circa # house in the village of southport where her studio will be in an open loft above the garage ms coopers painting sculptures look so much like real objects they have to be touched to sense the difference the raised folds of a dress the puffiness of a quilt or the hooked texture of a rug is uncannily captured on paper that she makes herself one of the underlying themes of my work is talking about it is it a rug or a quilt or a painting of a hooked rug or quilt ms cooper mused they are in essence visual puns that play with the visual context of an object humor is a level on which the work is experienced at the same time it is appreciated esthetically her direction began with a collection of real quilts they covered walls of her home were layered on shelves in an antique cupboard and strewn over furniture part of the reason i started to do this was to satisfy my inquisitive nature said ms cooper who has a masters in fine arts degree from pratt institute where she majored in sculpture i wanted to recreate quilts even their texture by painting them and to capture the sensibility of old age and discoloration she said at the time she was amassing her quilt collections she was looking for a concept to challenge the premise of a class called new forms i believe that all new forms are an evolution of old forms she said so i was looking for subject matter to challenge the premise of the course the quilt suggested itself because you could relate it to a number of traditional fine arts processes techniques of sculpture collage and painting the trick was putting all those old forms together in the subject of a quilt and taking them into an avant garde art class where everyone thought they were having a discussion of the quilt as a traditional form of craft halfway through they realized we were talking about a painting of a quilt at heart ms cooper continued they are traditional paintings on paper but because of their trompe loeil nature they were taken out of their traditional context i used the process for my thesis show while still in the process of figuring out the process pat parsons and carol webb owners of a former gallery in new canaan saw fragments of the first quilt and asked her to do a show it was completely sold out the process is tedious and time consuming and ms cooper was able to create only # to # quilt paintings a year her work is now done only on commission through galleries at janis aldridge in washington d c and on nantucket at sailors valentine gallery ms cooper does two shows a year christmas and summer for which themes change she went from quilts to t shirts to ties to portraits without people hawaiian shirts antique dresses then hooked rugs what im doing for the current show she said is going back and doing thematic work in a different way using the flag as a subject allows me to incorporate all that ive done like a hooked rug with flags dresses with stars and stripes and heart quilts in red white and blue she looks forward to working with dresses again incorporating flower motifs and imbuing hooked rugs with jungle animals pluckked from folk art depictions folk is what i look at as a source of inspiration she said im doing it from an informed and intellectual perspective where as folk art is unschooled
