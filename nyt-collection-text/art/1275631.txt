for some in hollywood the long feared strikes of the spring and summer of # are already beginning the town is really starting to quiet down from a production standpoint said amir malin chairman of artisan entertainment an independent film production and distribution company right now almost all of us are on hold when negotiations broke down last week between the writers guild of america and representatives of the major hollywood studios and television networks even those who had been trying to ignore the prospect of potential strikes this spring and summer by writers and actors were finally left staring the catastrophe square in the face it has caused many in the entertainment industry to go beyond wondering whether a strike will occur and instead begin calculating who will be hurt the worst the television and movie studios the strikers or the production workers caught in the middle you cannot emphasize enough the amount of damage that the strikes would do to the production industry in this country said bob solomon a senior vice president at liberty live wire which provides post production services for film and television and has warned its workers to expect layoffs if the strikes occur i am talking about personal devastation for people who cant afford to go two months without a paycheck as well as a flight of intellectual know how from which i am not sure the industry will ever recover the # # members of the writers guild whose contract with the alliance of motion picture and television producers expires at midnight may # had been in early negotiations for almost six weeks before the talks were suspended over the issue of residuals how much the writers will be paid under the new contract for use of their work beyond the first run in movie theaters and the first broadcast on television while both sides said they remained open to new talks and were hopeful of a settlement the guild decided that the gap between them was too large to continue talking at the moment even more threatening to hollywood is the prospect of a second strike by the # # members of the screen actors guild and the american federation of television and radio artists which represent actors in films and on most television programs like sitcoms and dramatic series their contract expires on june # and while the studios and networks could probably weather a writers strike for several months before feeling a pinch a walkout by actors would shut down production overnight and force others from directors to editors to the people who serve meals on the set out of work there are two aspects to it said nick counter chief negotiator for the producers one is what is the impact if the writers go out on strike and the other is what if the actors go out too theres a substantial difference between the two if only the writers go out on strike little impact would be felt until august he said when it would be time to begin production for the fall television season if the actors go out though it would be time to close up the shop news programs reality shows like survivor and others that do not use actors would be able to continue producing episodes the writers for those shows are covered by a separate contract that expires in november so they could continue working too but sitcoms dramatic series television movies and virtually all theatrical film production would cease in an instant until now the effects of the impending strikes have been masked by a rush to production as studios have attempted to get as many films finished as possible before the june # deadline but that surge is beginning to dry up films that do not begin principal photography by early april have little chance of finishing by the deadline and there is usually a month or more of preproduction work entertainment consumers will first feel the impact on television among the programs that would be affected earliest are live late night comedy shows like cbss late show with david letterman and nbcs tonight show during the last strike when the writers walked out in # nbcs late night with david letterman and the tonight show both went into reruns for several weeks but then the tonight host johnny carson decided to go back into production under a special exemption from the union and mr letterman followed suit maria pope the executive producer of late show said she and mr letterman had not yet decided what to do this time and nbc said mr leno has told it that he would respect a strike and would not produce new shows during a conference call with reporters last week leslie moonves the president of cbs television said that in the event of a strike the network could rely on a schedule heavy in reality programs like survivor and news magazines like # minutes ii and # hours bruce helford who is currently producing four half hour network comedies including the drew carey show and norm for abc said the recent success of reality programs had made the timing of the labor negotiations unfortunate and had put writers at a disadvantage he said a strike would have longer term implications as well giving reality and news programs a fresh opportunity to make inroads with audiences and perhaps making it even harder for comedy and dramatic series to recapture viewers and broadcast time after a settlement was reached since new series will not be announced by the networks until mid may and production work on them would not begin until early august a strike longer than three months would make it impossible to get them on the air in the fall most current programs that are being carried to next season will conclude production in april and then begin shooting next season in august so they too would not be ready for the fall but some producers have agreed to requests to make extra episodes of their series this season these extra shows could be held over until the fall this might be enough to provide a bit of a buffer and give the network if it wishes the appearance of a limited fall season the wb for instance which does not have a news division that it can rely on to fill open time slots ordered extra episodes of the steve harvey show and for your love which will be shown in the fall it also held back a new drama dead last and will show it in the fall likewise tnt delayed the showing of the second season of its drama set on wall street bull pushing it back to the fall to say the timing of the guild strike deadline is bad for the networks is a super bowl size understatement may # comes just weeks before the big television sponsors make their advanced advertising purchases for the new fall prime time schedules just how badly that will affect the networks bottom lines is unclear each will unveil a fully developed fall schedule in may and try to sell ads for it regardless of the strike threat but whether advertisers would be confident in the networks ability to deliver is another question it is anybodys guess as to whether ad sales could hold up this spring longtime advertising and network executives said wall street analysts warned last week that the writers guilds strike deadline raised the possibility for the first time in years that the networks would record negative growth in their annual may advance advertising sales period during the # strike the networks actually had slightly more revenue during the may advance sales period than they had the year before but the gains dwindled later in the year at the strikes conclusion in august the networks were slow to get their shows back on track with rushed and late starts to their biggest hits the networks lost as much as # percent of their overall ratings and were forced to compensate their sponsors with millions of dollars worth of free ad time tim spengler executive vice president and director of national broadcast at initiative media a media buying firm said he was still not sure what his strategy will be its tricky he said were not going to know whats going to happen so how much do you want to divert from the networks and then what if you find out the strike got settled in two months and theyre fine still he predicted that any reduction in network television ad buying this spring will have more to do with the soft economy than the threatened strike by contrast the major movie studios have been able to produce enough films to keep them in business well into # a few studio officials even said they believed there would be enough films in the can by the strike deadline to last into early # indeed the studios may see a boost in profits from the strike as they reap profits from previously produced films without shouldering the costs of new ones certainly the impact on the film studios will not be as immediate or initially as severe as what the television networks and cable channels will feel but i think its na ve to believe that it would be a very long time before the impact is felt in movies said jeffrey katzenberg one of the founders of the dreamworks studio and a member of the producers negotiating team indeed he said the effect could be felt as early as the summer of # a long way away in television thinking but right around the corner in the movie world i think in terms of the larger event movies the ones that take a lot of time and a lot of preparation they are going to be the ones where there will be the most immediate impact mr katzenberg said while the studios have been rushing films through production in anticipation of a strike he said a look at the kinds of movies that are being made reveals a relative dearth of the kind of big budget event type films that have been hollywoods bread and butter for a quarter century most of the volume of production that has been taking place recently has been the small movies that could be rushed into production on a very short schedule mr katzenberg said interestingly enough one of the results of all of this is that there will be more of that kind of product in the short term than maybe we have experienced in a while i dont know if thats good or bad john mclean the executive director of the writers guild said he did not want to discuss how a strike might affect his members because he wanted everyone to focus instead on forging an agreement and averting the strike my concern is that im still trying to make a deal he said there are a lot of options other than a strike we are eight to nine weeks away from the deadline on this contract and ive tried to stay away from the word strike
