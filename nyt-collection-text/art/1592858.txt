the mid #th century was not kind to the liechtensteins long a pillar of the austro hungarian empire owner of some # castles and palaces across europe the family was forced by world war ii and the soviet era to retreat to the tiny principality tucked between austria and switzerland that carries its name in the #s and #s it was even obliged to sell off part of its vast art collection to make ends meet but the new millennium has begun well for prince hans adam ii # the current head of the liechtenstein dynasty the familys finances have recovered enough for him to spend # million of his own money on refurbishing one of his two remaining palaces in vienna and on restoring it to its #th century vocation as a museum the princely collections last seen by the public at the metropolitan museum of art in new york in # are on view in vienna for the first time in almost # years does vienna already crowded with some # museums need one more the liechtenstein museum is different not only because it can tap one of the worlds largest private collections but also because it reflects the idiosyncrasies of generations of private collectors further the museum which opened in march contains works by raphael rubens rembrandt frans hals van dyck and others the prince knows it is not possible to make money out of a museum said johann kraftner the museums director and curator of the collection but we hope to cover our running costs from ticket sales we think we can break even with # # to # # visitors per year the garden palace which houses the museum is itself part of the show a neo classical structure built at the turn of the #th century it became viennas first museum in # and showed the princely collections until germany annexed austria in # after world war ii with the collection safely stored in the principality of liechtenstein the building first became a food distribution center and later a wholesale outlet for building materials from the early #s until # as the family fortunes recovered helped by liechtensteins status as a tax haven vienna rented the palace as its museum of modern art then when vienna built its new modern art museum the liechtenstein family decided to recover the palace for its own collection much of its #th century glory was restored including fine frescoes that had long been hidden by plaster part of its english style landscape gardens were also returned to their original baroque look still the clock has not been turned back entirely in the #th and #th centuries almost every inch of wall was covered with paintings and with some # # works in the collection this approach would again be possible but it is no longer in vogue instead just # works make up the new permanent collection which is spread over eight galleries on the first floor naturally they include only the best we want to guide people through all the important periods of the collection which covers from the #th to the #th centuries mr kraftner said peter paul rubens is the museums main star works by the flemish old master include his last assumption of the virgin painted around # the so called decius mus cycle eight large paintings that served as designs for tapestries and that now occupy the grand gallery venus in front of the mirror one of his finest mythological works and several portraits of children including his own chubby cheeked daughter clara serena most of the display though is presented in a loosely chronological manner starting with early italian religious painting and leading to the renaissance and the artistic flowering in northern europe some of the finest works are portraits by raphael bernhard strigel lucas cranach the elder francesco di cristofano and paris bordone the baroque era is represented by italians like paolo pagani and sebastiano ricci and northerners like van dyck hals and rubens himself the galleries also present sculptures notably some exceptional bronzes by mantegna sansovino and benzi as well as furniture and porcelain frescoes reinforce the mood of baroque luxury nowhere more than in the magnificent hercules hall the largest secular baroque room in vienna where the story of hercules is recounted in a vast ceiling fresco painted between # and # by the italian andrea pozzo a reward for the palaces restoration was the rediscovery of frescoes painted in the early #th century by johann michael rottmayr for the ground floor and staircases these were plastered over in the #th century to make room for a ceiling painting from another liechtenstein palace now they too have been restored on the ground floor of the palace prince hans adam has reconstructed the library in the former gentlemens apartment by bringing large numbers of leather bound books from his hilltop palace in vaduz the capital of liechtenstein a golden carriage used by one of his forefathers on a royal mission to paris in # stands in the palaces main foyer in the other wing the former ladies apartment has been designated for temporary exhibitions the opening show neo classic and biedermeier which runs through nov # dwells on the #th century neo classical movement in northern europe and its accompanying biedermeier style which celebrated bourgeois devotion to music dance and poetry through painting and furniture the decision to reopen a museum in the garden palace prompted prince hans adam to resume collecting for instance he bought back a still life by jan van huysum and a portrait by bernardo zaganelli both sold by his father a half century ago other recent purchases include frans halss portrait of a man frans snyderss recumbent lioness and two sculptures by mollinarolo one art market expert estimated the prince was spending up to # million a year on art wed like to buy back more works sold in the #s or at least find replacements that fill the gaps mr kraftner said we also want more #th century viennese paintings and more #th century international in the meantime through an association called private art collections the liechtenstein museum plans to share some of its space with other well known austrian family collections notably the sch nborn buchheim collection and the count harrach family collection joint exhibitions with other partner collections are also scheduled for # the message is clear privately owned art is also for public enjoyment
