west #d street through aug # teddy shapiro chris wilder petersburg # prince street through july # this pair of one person shows introduces two young painters whose efforts have little in common but who complement each other well teddy shapiro is something of a traditionalist whose tradition of choice seems to be the #s phenomenon of new image painting the wry schematic figuration of neil jenney nicholas africano and michael hurson his paintings feature several unrelated figures seen from radically different angles against flatly painted monochromes of dark peach light blue or green his style of rendering is blunt and a trifle naive almost of the storybook variety mr shapiros figures and their rumpled clothes like his slightly muted mundane colors evoke the #s or #s more the days of radio than of television but his sense of a fluid yet fractured space in which everyone is separate is echoed by titles that imply complex often psychological scenarios in you dont know me you dont a distant woman hands on hips looks up from a light orange surface above her float three men seen in different sizes from different viewpoints the largest a man in a sports jacket and a red tie sits listlessly in an armchair as if contemplating some recent confrontation in make a mask of your own face wear it or hang it up we might be interrupting an acting class one man in gym clothes leans against a strip of deep red at the paintings edge while another in street clothes flies through the air on the back of a chair meanwhile a woman in red exits purposefully at left as if set on taking a break elsewhere one of the best things about these paintings is the thick swirling wet on wet way mr shapiro paints the clothes of his subjects it gives them weight and importance and a sense of inner turmoil that seems to be the central subject of his art the appellation of painter applies much more loosely to chris wilder an artist who seems to change styles and materials with each new artwork the extraterrestrial encounter or its simulation is a recurring theme one work titled u f o sighting at monte carlo is a color photocopy enlargement of a news photograph to which the artist has added an entirely appropriate purplish tint we sense the imminence of an alien presence another work narrates the artists attempt to do a public commission using a hologram projection too complex to be realized this text appears on canvas overpainted with sloshy abstraction means that are decidedly more available three small abstractions in shiny tones of purple orange and blue concern u f o sightings respectively on the moon in death valley and under water mr wilder works with an appealing if youthful nonchalance and seems equally at home with the physical and the conceptual unlike mr shapiros his show is scattershot to say the least but the pieces work well together and their ensemble effect makes you wonder whats next
