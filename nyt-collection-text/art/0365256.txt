years old of smithtown works full time taking photos of criminals crime scenes battered bodies and police evidence he spends his spare time taking black and white photos of delicate landscapes with a large # by # inch view camera each landscape is printed with a time consuming palladium based process the palladium process gives a better gradation of tone he said his landscapes are being exhibited at the pasta viola restaurant in stony brook other than having victims look through mug shot books this is the first time his photographs have been on display i normally wouldnt put them up in restaurant he said but they made a nice presentation of the prints people are noticing the photos the chef leslie sofarelli said we have a different type of restaurant here our customers acknowledge the ambience they look at the walls i actually do look at the walls said a customer rita redko and the photos looked wonderful she added mr pawlik who has worked at the jail for five years said he would like to do fine art photography full time but the pay is good he said and the mug shots can be interesting i liked the captain of the valdez he said what was his name hazelwood he was very respectable he looked like the head of a big ship was the skipper wearing a captains cap hats are not allowed in jail mr pawlik said new church for old faith dr nabil el deiry is coptic its a religion one of the oldest it was established in #
