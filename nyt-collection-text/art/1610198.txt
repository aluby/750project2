mr piccolomini added making it stable enough to withstand international travel the restoration also produced significant new scholarship the painting had been firmly attributed to raphael until the late #th century when it was suggested that the figures coloring was closer to that of one of the artists pupils giulio romano the paintings authorship was debated for the next two centuries but the findings of the restoration including x rays of the painting which have been recorded in a catalog that is being published in the united states to coincide with the exhibitions revealed figure drawings under the paintings surface that are similar to extant sketches and drawings by raphael some scholars also believe that the intimacy of the sitter confirms that she was raphaels lover although others arent so sure thats a question that will be debated for generations to come mr bailey said many historians like to think that the artists untimely death at age # was related to a passionate affair the renaissance biographer giorgio vasari said that raphael could not give his mind to his work because of his infatuation with his mistress and implied that the artists sexual exploits killed him its an image that has captured the imagination of so many artists from ingres to picasso along with the fascinating stories that have spun around it mr bailey said elton johns yard sale as passionate a collector as sir elton john is he can never be accused of being a pack rat over the years the rock star has bought and sold vintage cars paintings furniture decorative objects and more recently he hired jane jackson a former atlanta dealer to work on his vast photography collection and to compile a digital catalog of his holdings it was only when he was able to survey everything he had that he decided some pruning was in order so on oct #
