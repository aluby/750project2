visitors to davison art center at wesleyan university in middletown can see the pair of well cut black riding boots or rather their silhouettes at # paces hanging on the wall that faces the entrance of the gallery the image is jim dines and he produced it in # at universal limited art editions the print shop in west islip l i that was founded by tanya grosman in # and first visited by peter and susan ralston in # eventually the ralstons acquired # prints half of which now hang at the davison under the title # years at universal limited art editions on view through oct # the ralstons he is a wesleyan alumnus and new york city real estate broker she is an editor at alfred knopf started collecting soon after getting married and have not confined their patronage to the long island print shop but as the shows curator stephen j lucey notes in the catalogue the ralstons count among their treasures some of the most significant images pulled there and credit the workshops proprietor with educating them in connoisseurship born in siberia tanya grosmans is a success story with miraculous aspects it begins in the siberia of # where she was born the daughter of a typographer the story continues with immigration to germany by way of japan in order to escape the russian revolution with marriage to the painter maurice grosman in # followed by a move to paris and in # flight to spain to avoid the german invasion of france three years later the couple arrived in the united states and maurice grosman went to work making screen print reproductions of works by picasso matisse and other european artists until he had a heart attack the grosmans then moved from new york city to their summer house on long island it was tanya grosmans idea that her husband turn his attention to contemporary american artists and mary callery and max weber were the first to accept the invitation in the mid #s it was then the couple discovered the lithography stones buried in their front lawn by the early #s the print shops repertory included virtually all the processes lithographs woodcuts and etchings an artist would need stanley william hayter had introduced the european concept of the fine art print when he relocated his atelier # from paris to new york city during world war ii but tanya grosman with her somewhat vollardish ideas is credited with precipitating the american print renaissance as the curator mr lucey tells it the shop began as a modest word of mouth operation larry rivers who collaborated with the poet frank ohara brought in grace hartigan helen frankenthaler and marisol the late dealer john bernard myers introduced one of his artists robert goodnough tanya grosman herself attracted jasper johnss attention by lugging in lithography stones to his manhattan studio and in the process meeting and persuading his neighbor robert rauschenberg to work with the shop one by one the cream of new york artists were given the run of the shop with printers at their beck and call food music and the unwavering attention of the hostess entrepreneur it was a golden age that ended with tanya grosmans death in # and mr lucey concludes with calvin tomkinss observation that at the shop printmaking lost its stigma as a craft as minor art and became a legitimate form for the highest esthetic ambitions the enterprise lives on under the direction of bill goldston who is one of the master printers credited in the catalogue along with robert blackburn ben berns and others jasper johns dominates the show numerically with # prints # of them lithographs of the #s and #s images like those of the coat hanger the flag paint brushes soaking in a savarin coffee can and the rectangle filled with all over cross hatching this an exceptionally fine print in black and gray on a lighter gray ground and bordered in black the remainder are etching aquatints from the seasons a mid #s series in which the artist recycles shapes like the silhouette of a figure his own a disembodied hand and the goblet with contours doubling as the profile of picasso mr johns is as hermetic as ever in these designs but the naivete that has always been latent in his art is more obvious re emergence of a sculptor mr rauschenberg is represented by seven prints of drawn and collage images including the monochrome portrait of tanya grosman taken from a photograph and combined with a rectangular palette form fritz glarner robert motherwell larry rivers saul steinberg cy twombly and susan rothenberg are also present together with elizabeth murray whose lithograph suggesting an overturned table with carafes is remarkable for having required no fewer than # stones to produce most interestig however are the black and white prints of lee bontecou a sculptor who was known during the #s for intimidating assemblages that evoked simultaneously associations with human orifices and machines but who is rarely seen nowadays the most handsome of the images at the davison tend to one or another of these extremes notably the twin propeller shapes in the etching aquatint fifth stone sixth stone plate vi an illustration for poems by tony towle eighth stone a lithograph of an eye shape surrounded by fleshy folds and a lithograph the more recent sixteenth stone a kind of geological cross section with layers inhabited by squid like creatures ms bontecou could be a throwback to odilon redon there is no question as to the high art status of all these prints but neither is there doubt as to the presence of the craftsmen aiding the artists also at the davison through oct # is #th century linoleum cuts a show organized by william mccarthy that proves the linoleum cut is no longer childs play indeed it has not been that since the #s when as mr mccarthy explains in a statement claude power and his students at the grosvenor school in london began exploring the medium with a view to color printing the show however opens with max webers # nude engraved white on a black ground it also includes two prints atypical of the medium one a # scene of horses dragging lumber through a forest by ernest william watson the other a # view of an estate in princeton by louis novak both are beautifully colored simple as it is the linocut lends itself to virtuosity witness the king of clowns a poster in which picasso used the reduction method that is he cut first the white areas printing the entire edition before cutting and printing the brown and then the black one thinks ahead with this procedure and there is no turning back chuck close does the same thing with his portrait of lucas samaras showing all the stages plus the final version the show is nonetheless interesting for being a down to earth adjunct to the luxury of universal limited art editions art
