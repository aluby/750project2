behind honore daumier lies #th century paris a city of bourgeois assurance and political uncertainty stolid and histrionic like every great city it breathed self awareness no one contributed more in midcentury to that collective parisian sense of self than daumier who died at age # in # the exhibition of his work at the phillips collection in washington on view until may # suggests the range of his artistic expression if not its utter immensity daumier worked in unfired clay and oil paints in bronze plaster and watercolor but his innumerable impressions of paris are literally that drawings made directly on lithographic stone and printed for immediate use in one newspaper or another daumiers paris is not a cityscape the broad views are missing in his lithographs he alludes only to the passing moment and the same is true of the city he reveals occasionally a cobbled square can be glimpsed a placard a shop window a brief stretch of skyline through the window of a moon gazing bluestocking but the architecture daumier loves is that of the cravat the chapeau the crinoline his idea of urban scenery is the faces of lawyers actors and legislators of clients and audiences men and women of flamboyant features that a caricaturist could urge into satire the result is a sense of unassuming intimacy a feeling as you look from face to face that paris lies right before you even though the city is rarely visible in their time daumiers lithographs came and went the way the newspaper does day after day to create the intangible effect of the metropolis its hauteur as well as its domesticity daumier did not need to show paris to the parisians he needed only to show the parisians to themselves
