stuart diamond mckee gallery # fifth avenue near #th street through oct # over the last few years stuart diamond has moved from making painted wood reliefs to painting on big wood panels the change from a shallow three dimensionality to true flatness has improved and clarified his art without eliminating its basic problem which is an incipient academicism his new paintings resemble civic minded w p a murals forced through the skeptical sieve of pictorial simultaneity that sigmar polke julian schnabel and david salle made famous in the #s mr diamonds astoundingly clogged robustly painted version of this simultaneity telegraphs big elementary school ideas science art nature technology and military might but in ambiguous ways which suggest that human progress isnt necessarily so great or even so possible in deceptions lures and lies in a technological space images of fish fish lures a galleon a locomotive and much much else share the surface overlapping and menacing one another like the prisoners of a crazed overcrowded museum diorama in furor arma ministrat the forms include grimacing african heads and masks snakes a shark and a world war ii jet fighter whose nose is painted as they often were to resemble a sharks toothy snout elsewhere the prow of an aircraft carrier merges with the face of a sting ray although this fusion seems to be the artists own concoction a degree of monstrousness natural or man made deadly or recreational connects these forms which are rendered for the most part in shades of gray and a reddish brown many of them also reflect a certain primal fear whether of nature of the spirit world or of ones fellow humans and mr diamond implies that it has remained constant throughout history this is perhaps clearest in mans progress at problem solving which includes in more breathing room than usual a voodoo sculpture two jets a naval destroyer the fragments of a coat of armor and several squid the main problem is that while these paintings are full of different signs of life and death they lack immediate pictorial life although mr diamond paints with authoritative flair his titles and subjects are ultimately more gripping and more varied than anything he does with paint or color the exception is thank goodness for the experts whose colors and surfaces emit a degree of visual presence otherwise lacking part of the dazzling effect of #s simultaneity was the way its juxtaposition of images also made styles collide so far mr diamond has succeeded only in making worlds collide its no small feat and it seems especially appropriate to the confusion and doubt that hang over the planet at the end of the second millennium but it is also primarily a narrative effect that only momentarily disguises the essential monotony of his pictorial vision
