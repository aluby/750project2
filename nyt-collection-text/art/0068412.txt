generations drawn to a heroic figure in an analytical unromantic age listen to robert longo whose large mixed media works reflecting upon the power of images and sounds are not normally identified either with rodin or with european art after quitting school in # i went to italy for five months and looked at the archetypal artists like michelangelo and cellini when i got to paris i went to the louvre and there too nothing really affected me when i got to the rodin museum it was like everything hit and lined up in order i ended up going there every day and doing all the things an artist is supposed to do staying on the lawn drawing sculpture reading about rodin it was like being aware of being an artist for the first time when i went back there this summer it was eerie i saw works of mine coming out of sculptures by rodin i had not remembered even having seen this is only one indication that contemporary artists are more involved with rodin than art professionals might expect indeed there was almost no trace of him and his followers in the two major modern sculpture surveys in # and # at the solomon r guggenheim museum and the pompidou center in paris both shows were informed by the belief that in order to be serious and influential and to compete with painting modern sculpture had to liberate itself from the tradition of monolithic figurative statuary and involve itself primarily with its own materials and language beyond the boundaries of this formalist esthetic however rodin has always been present indeed it would be hard for sculptors involved with narrative sentiment sexuality and the expressive possibilities of the human figure most of which formalism was determined to banish from art not to consider him in the thoroughness and vitality of his modeling in his search for grandiose narrative schemes that could reflect a sense of fragmentation and incompleteness in his worship of matter and spirit the human body and the gothic cathedral in his attraction both to uniqueness and duplication originality and repetition and in his strange hybrid constructions combining different sculptures and different stages of the sculptural process rodin is a force too complex controversial and abundant ever to go away this is apparent in the statements of artists from # to # years old who have recently had occasion to speak about rodin in conjunction with a major exhibition of rodin sculpture and drawings at the hayward gallery in london last winter the arts council of great britain asked the english sculptor raymond mason to give a talk in conjunction with the sept # inauguration of a permanent installation of # sculptures by rodin at the brooklyn museum a gift from iris and b gerald kantor the curator lynne ambrosini invited three contemporary sculptors bryan hunt alain kirili and jonathan silver to discuss rodin in front of his works the interviews will be published in the accompanying catalogue it is not that the observations of these artists are new what is significant is that with the exception of hunt who remains interested but somewhat detached their words are passionate and engaged among sculptors who model clay plaster or wax there is close attention to the way rodin worked his surfaces and controlled light in all the artists there is a keen awareness of the importance of drawing and process nothing has more of an edge than the discussions of the sexuality in rodins work as conscious as rodin was of himself as a sculptor his work is in some way about the possibility and necessity of abandonment nothing about his work is more sharply in contrast with the artistic and critical self consciousness of this age his sculptures and drawings of the female nude are marked by a trust in desire and flesh that may have been unprecedented catherine lampert the curator of the london show remarks in the catalogue that rodin was lecherous she also writes that rodin was the first sculptor to want to make womens sexuality important the artists involved in these talks and interviews are very different kirili is the only one whose work is largely abstract he is a compatriot of rodin who has been living in the united states for several years he models in clay and terra cotta his assemblages may include wood the works for which he is best known are in iron in his recent forged aluminum sculptures he has been searching for an effect that is at the same time restrained and orgiastic hunt was one of the first american sculptors coming out of minimal conceptual and earth art to sense the possibilities of bronze and his flowing sculptures contain allusions to natural processes and the human figure one of the casts of rodins balzac at the los angeles county museum was actually the first sculpture i ever encountered in my life he said silver and mason are the sculptors most involved with modeling and they are the most thoughtful about rodins working methods both work slowly silver is a sculptural descendant of rodin one of the artists most affected by what ms lampert described as rodins radical absence of decorum he will include in his disjunctive syncretic constructions any aspect from any stage of the casting process like rodin he makes numerous plaster casts remodels them rips them apart incorporates them in new works has the new works cast breaks them up reassembles the parts and so on in an endless process of creation and destruction mason is # years old he has lived in paris for # years and his words like the eccentric knobby figures inhabiting his narrative reliefs have a curious combination of oversimplification and subtlety he categorically dismisses minimal art conceptual art and arte povera as well as almost all art of the past # years he is the only one of these artists at ease with rodins grandiose ambition and with the idea of the masterpiece rodins burghers of calais was an inspiration for his illuminated crowd installed in front of the esso building in montreal the most ambitious outdoor figurative sculpture in recent years for these artists the sexuality of rodins work is a primary issue in one version of balzac the phallus of the bulbous standing figure seems to grow out of the earth like a root like the monumental balzac rodins monument to victor hugo with muses clumped around the naked figure like angels and furies caused a scandal rodin was no longer looking for a symbol of gentle cerebral inspiration but for a way of visualizing how untamed carnal energy stoked the fires of creative drive ms lampert writes of this work for silver this uninhibited unconflicted sexuality is part of what makes rodin alien theres that kind of love of female flesh as an object of lust and dominating colonizing sensuality expressed throughout rodins work which is not particularly sympathetic to modern attitudes he said what im getting at is not so much that rodins work is sexist per se but that most contemporary art lacks sensuality its often preoccupied with erotic subject matter but it lacks a direct physical sensuality its much more detached ironical and thats why i think that rodin doesnt address us directly longo talks about rodins kiss and his own use of the kiss as a motif he makes a provocative distinction between the coolness of sculptures by rodin in which couples are embracing and individual images of women such as iris messenger of the gods which for him have real heat if the single images are more erotic than the couples it is surely because part of the couple could be imaginatively occupied by rodin himself for kirili the erotic dimension of rodin is something of a cause his book on rodins erotic drawings with texts by him and the french writer philippe sollers was published earlier this year in france kirili is profoundly aware how out of place rodins dionysian vision has been in recent american art he believes that the sexuality of rodins art is of paramount importance to an appropriate understanding of the artist only this can make it possible to understand the scandalous side of rodin the obscene rodin as well as his audacity and transgressions only this he believes can enable us to understand the radical dimension of rodins work the dimension that continues to make the art establishment uneasy for him the sculpture of balzac with its blend of spirituality and sexuality is a model in it creative genius is inseparable from sexuality a vision that means a lot to artists like me at a time when the development of art is envisioned solely in terms of its own issues a fundamentally formalist and asexual vision the sexuality in rodins sculptures and drawings grows out of a feeling for nature rodin was born into a century in which nature could still be a guide and when the threat to nature from industry could lead some artists to treat it as a religion his work is studded with ideas of generation regeneration abundance and fertility he worked from nature in order to be guided by and partake of it along with other #th century artists like delacroix courbet and monet rodin became in some sense a force of nature while kirili is concerned with the active volcanic way rodin set out almost to become nature mason feels that what has been forgotten is a reverence for nature that links rodin to cezanne he blames the oversight on the need of modernism to use the past to serve its own ends the current tendency mason said is to build up the late rodin because the more arms and legs he saws off the nearer he resembles brancusi in a similar way cezanne is assimilated into modernism the first cubist yet picasso and braque threw immediately out of the window the essential nature of cezanne the receuillement the contemplative prayer he painted nature all his life almost on his knees as an act of worship what i can say about cezanne can be said about rodin for silver rodin was strongest when working from nature he points out that rodin used very wet clay which gives the earth an even more suggestive and elemental feel the wetter the clay the more responsive it is to the artists touch the surer the artist must be of the current between earth model hand and eye for me silver said the closer he is to a life scale and the more attentive he is to his model the more i am responsive to his work because i think that he drew his vitality directly from his observations his work gets progressively weaker as it gets larger and more literary when he worked on a human scale he didnt just imitate form but dealt with the stresses of modern life on the individual as seen directly in their impress on human flesh thats where hes a master psychologist silver said that a subject like rodins mistress is highly personal it has a physical sensual apprehension of a psychological state which is expressed in the face this sensual responsiveness to the world around him and the intoxication with which he was capable of participating physically in his sculpture help make rodin a profound prolific and problematical figure who is impossible to forget people label rodin a frightful man the man who bullied camille claudel said kirili referring to the sculptor colleague and mistress of rodin who went mad and who is believed by some authorities not catherine lampert to have been destroyed by him but its time to realize how his figures of female bodies express jouissance which the brooklyn museum catalogue defines as intense enjoyment especially sexual art view
