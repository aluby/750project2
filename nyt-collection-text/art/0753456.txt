after a walk through the multimedia sound and fury of bruce naumans retrospective at the museum of modern art with its shouting voices and casts of dead animals even the hardiest viewer may want to decompress tom friedmans little show of paintings and sculptures in the museums lobby gallery is a good place to start if mr naumans recent work is big loud and heavy brow beatingly sardonic when its funny just brow beating when its not mr friedmans work is light and small so small that it could easily escape notice to take an example a minute white speck of material under plexiglas on the wall turns out to be a self portrait of the artist carved from an aspirin tablet the cure for a nauman imposed headache possibly although mr friedman who is # and began his career in chicago can cause headaches of his own his laborious angels on the head of a pin feats of miniaturism are sometimes as demanding on the eye as mr naumans high volume rants are on the ear the surface of everything a scuffed looking piece of paper on the floor near the portrait bust is covered with almost microscopic words all the entries in a small english dictionary copied out by hand in blue ink work like this seems to exist partly in the realm of ritual think of such examples of devotional virtuosity as rosary beads carved with faces and miniature korans carved in nutshells partly in folk art ships in bottles and partly in sheer personal obsessiveness in mr friedmans work as in mr naumans that obsessiveness takes the form of a wittily fetishistic approach to the body a bar of plain white hand soap smoothed with use is marked with a pattern of fine perfectly aligned concentric circles made from embedded hair and a flesh colored globe adhering to a corner of the wall just outside the gallery is molded from countless wads of chewed bubble gum equally labor intensive and funny is mr friedmans take on art styles that have preceded him both the purity of hard edge painting and the personal touch of gestural abstraction are alluded to in a patch of aquamarine toothpaste brushed directly onto the wall a bristling bush of triangles made of folded construction paper suggests a minimalist structure and earth art is accounted for in a little sphere of gray brown dust sitting on the gallery floor mr friedman certainly has distant roots in process art and conceptualism richard tuttle comes to mind as do ray johnson and fluxus but his immediate forebears include several contemporary chicago based artists tony tasset mitchell kane jeanne dunning and vincent shine among them they have all routinely used mundane household materials and images to smudge the now all but invisible line between high and low culture like them mr friedman is less interested in creating shattering effects than in introducing a perceptual blip or two into the everyday data flow in one piece he painstakingly reconstructs with paint and press type a classroom map of north america the colors are bright the place names clear it takes a second to realize somethings wrong the continent is upside down and flipped with the atlantic on the left and maine on the bottom this is america viewed from the north pole the joke has just enough lag time to let mr friedmans skewed vision of the world register this vision tends to be open ended and slightly pixilated it accommodates both jokes there are many and cosmological musings the latter prompted by the little orbits on the bar of soap the floating planet made of gum and the little ball of gray dust sitting in a kind of corona of its own disintegration over there in the corner disintegration of the body of the universe is certainly a cause for anxiety and there are all kinds of ways to cope with it mr naumans maximalist overload is one mr friedmans conceptually nimble shaping and ordering another his approach seems to be in the ascendant at the moment shared by some accomplished younger artists sioban liddell and gabriel orozco among them who together offer a promising new ripple if not exactly a wave for art in the #s tom friedman remains on view at the museum of modern art # west #d street manhattan through may # art review
