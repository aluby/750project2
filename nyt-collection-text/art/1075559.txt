doug aitken # gallery # west #d street chelsea through jan # doug aitken earns a living directing music videos for art galleries he creates video installations based on world roving geographical explorations including for example a visit to the infamous jonestown in guyana one of two polished but over complicated works on view here is a sequence of video projections designed to recreate a hike across an island in the caribbean where a volcano erupted in # entering the darkened gallery you first encounter a double projection presenting the artists view as he follows a rocky stream through the jungle in the next room another double projection offers a meandering tour of a bleak abandoned town finally you arrive at a room where three projections surround you with a desolate volcanic landscape and fog as a conradian journey to the ends of civilization this is haunting but the artsy multiplication of views distracts from whats most engaging which is the cinematic narrative in mr aitkens second piece three monitors are arranged in the center of the room so that you can walk around them blending banality and mystery they alternate views of semi urban blight car lots commercial strips and dreamlike scenes in which professional auctioneers chanting numbers and commentary stroll through empty spaces like a corporate lobby or an anonymous institutional hallway mr aitken has constructed a theatrical environment for this work including wooden benches walls painted yellow and yellow filtered skylights but his formal contrivances are not so compelling that you dont wish he would just make a regular movie ken johnson
