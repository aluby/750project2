lead with daring and precision two armed men in masks walked off one recent night with more than # valuable statuettes vases and other objects that had been found in the remains here of the ancient roman city of herculaneum with daring and precision two armed men in masks walked off one recent night with more than # valuable statuettes vases and other objects that had been found in the remains here of the ancient roman city of herculaneum the theft one of hundreds that occur in italy every year is believed by investigators to have been a hired job possibly commissioned abroad it has rekindled fears that the countrys artistic heritage may be headed for a thorough sacking after december # when trade barriers will fall and customs guards will all but disappear within the european community the more pessimistic among italian experts worry that this conversion of western europe into a single economic body with minimal checking of travelers baggage at borders will enable thieves to spirit away national treasures with near impunity a land with so much to steal art theft seems to be increasing worldwide and the pickings now are often easy in italy which is said by unesco to possess more than half of the worlds cultural holdings in its churches public buildings museums and private collections according to statistics compiled by the carabinieri the national police force # # paintings statues frescoes coins and other items were stolen in italy from # through # nearly half of those objects # # were recovered over the two decades and # # people were arrested but a great deal obviously slipped away and col emidio napolitano who heads the carabinieris # member art theft squad warns that # will certainly make our job more difficult already colonel napolitano says he detects an increase in organized crimes involvement in such thefts seepage may become deluge robberies aside there is a basic division between art exporting countries like italy and art importers like britain and west germany and many experts here fret that even the legal flow of artwork out of the country will turn into a flood after # if cultural properties are to be treated no differently from other goods then theoretically a renaissance painting could be moved about as freely as other italian products from shoes to salami some art critics fear that the loss to researchers would be particularly keen if art is bought like stocks by private investors it will no longer be public property that can be available for expert study and public enjoyment said giulio carlo argan an art critic and a former mayor of rome italy now tries to protect its patrimony through an often porous law enacted in # that requires government approval before a piece of art can be exported it applies to all works by artists who have been dead for at least # years no other country has such a tough law mr argan said i also dont know of anyone who is in prison for violating it besides he said major provisions may no longer be valid in a unified european market for instance the statute requires art owners to register their possessions with the government that may work for well known masterpieces or large collections but knowledgeable italians agree that only a minority of their countrymen obey the rule and if a statue is not registered they add it may be considered not an acknowledged work of art but just another piece of merchandise free to be circulated at will throughout an integrated european community without risk of customs checks or other controls new standards sought so italian officials art dealers economists and others have begun to campaign for communitywide standards that would add new layers of protection for italy and other art rich countries of the mediterranean like greece spain and france according to stefano rodota an italian member of parliament involved in european community negotiations northern importing countries are generally more disposed to lax rules moreover there are divisions even among italians about how restrictive the standards should be art dealers for example are not interested in regulations that would appreciably limit their overseas business opportunities there are also philosophical questions to be resolved to cite one why would it be legitimate to sell a # # year old roman vase in venice but not in antwerp when venice although obviously part of italy had no more to do with ancient rome than did the territory that now forms belgium prof paolo leon an italian economist who has studied the matter closely argues for a territorial definition of art in which an object found in say syracuse sicily should remain there that may no longer be a practical idea professor leon acknowledges but he insists at a minimum on some sort of communitywide registry of paintings and statues to keep europes heritage in europe otherwise he says items in the high priced art world will flow inexorably to where the money is the united states and increasingly japan a late beginning why should works of art go to japan just because they are now economically ahead he said then it will be taiwan then after that some other place italian experts agree that with # just around the corner they have begun their art protection campaign somewhat late they also acknowledge that they do not even know the extent of their patrimony despite unesco estimates that this country has # percent of the worlds cultural properties for the last # years prof oreste ferrari has been compiling a registry of known art pieces for the ministry of cultural affairs thus far he and his assistants have catalogued # # million pieces and professor ferrari reckons that this may represent no more than # percent of the total but lets not have false illusions he said the catalogue is a necessary first step toward protecting our patrimony but it is not a security system even catalogued items can be stolen and when it comes to guarding its own treasures many experts condemn italys performance over the years the theft on feb # at ercolano a few miles south of naples is a good example of the plundering that has gone on for decades late that night the two armed men took six unarmed guards by surprise then they easily punched through a wall to get inside a storeroom that housed hundreds of objects found long ago inside the well preserved ruins of ancient herculaneum which like nearby pompeii died when mount vesuvius erupted in a d # alarm still not installed for four hours the thieves picked their way leisurely through priceless treasures taking away a bronze vase in the shape of a womans head a small statue of the roman god bacchus a gold snakes head bracelet along with earrings coins bracelets # objects in all a theft that the supervising architect tommasina budetta later called a disaster one suspect has been arrested but the stolen objects have not been recovered in the post mortem art experts complained that security at the site was lax and they cited the fact that an alarm system planned as far back as # had yet to be installed the reason lack of government financing a recurring problem here although art and italy are almost synonymous the annual budget for the ministry of cultural affairs is a shade under # billion or roughly two tenths of # percent of total government spending cultural affairs which was created in # also lacks strong advocates each of the last three ministers came from the social democratic party a junior partner in the five party ruling coalition and none possessed the obvious stature of european culture ministers like jack lang of france melina mercouri of greece or jorge semprun of spain besides some experts point out italy has long indulged in the luxury of lackadaisical behavior in part because it often could count on a new art treasures turning up to take the place of one that had disappeared it was no different with the herculaneum robbery two weeks later archeologists digging at pompeii stumbled on a marble statue from the first century b c depicting a child on a dolphin it stood a little more than a foot high and seemed to be in fine condition
