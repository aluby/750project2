xl xavier laboulbenne gallery # west #nd street chelsea through feb # popular culture may be the mainspring for a lot of new art but it doesnt take a sociologist to see that what is inside galleries does not jibe with much of what is out on the street the british artist mike sale who lives and works in berlin makes the point with minimum fuss the centerpiece of his solo show is a shopping cart packed with found odds and ends that he bought intact from a homeless man in chelsea and moved indoors a white on white painting of the words people die of exposure seems to slide down the pristine gallery wall and across the floor there is a separate though not unrelated piece in the back room a single tunic or dress stitched from burlap its form based on ceremonial robes worn at royal funerals in africa the original garments were made of leopard skin which mr sale imitates with a pattern of appliqued buttonlike dots each made from a snippet of his hair the metaphoric connections between the works are oblique but moving paupers and kings trash and treasures him and me holland cotter art in review
