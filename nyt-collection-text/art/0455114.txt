the art dealer larry gagosian likes to make offers that clients cant refuse he once called robert half a prominent collector in beverly hills calif to ask if he would sell herald a # painting by franz kline that mr half had cherished for # years mr half said no through three or four phone calls finally he asked what price was being offered by the buyer identified as a mysterious mr goldman two million mr gagosian replied i told him the kline wasnt worth it mr half said the other day then he offered me # # million a couple of calls later mr half reluctantly gave in the buyer mr half said was not mr goldman at all but s i newhouse jr the publishing mogul a regular gagosian client known for paying top dollar the # year old mr gagosian who is not known as go go for nothing has brought millions of dollars worth of art into play with such tactics a fast stepping dealmaker with a talented eye and a keen appetite for the hunt he has risen from purveying decorative posters in los angeles in the mid #s to brokering art for high rollers like mr newhouse and charles saatchi the english advertising entrepreneur his cocky presence insatiable ambition and meteoric success in the resale market that is works that are resold or traded after their original purchase have made him for many a symbol of the bullish #s when artworks were traded like wall street commodities mr gagosians operational style bears another resemblance to the #s in his willingness to use leverage to keep his business growing at a time when the art market is sharply down and most new york galleries are retrenching he appears to be in a state of ebullient expansion much of it financed by borrowing against his inventory he is adding exhibition space to his headquarters on madison avenue near #th street and taking new digs in soho primarily for large scale sculpture and he is giving his competitors additional heartburn by stepping into the more prestigious primary market adding to his resale trade a small group of big ticket artists whose new work he will show hot from the studio in the gossipy highly competitive art world stories about mr gagosians driven behavior and sometimes corrosive relations with other dealers and clients proliferate as do questions about his backing his deal making and what he owes to whom but the most frequently asked question is how does he do it larry hustles said stanley grinstein a los angeles collector but you know right away that hes hustling and he doesnt try to hide it its part of his charm last fall mr gagosian wooed the painter david salle away from a # year relationship with the mary boone gallery more recently he snatched the painter philip taaffe away from ms boone after she had already advertised his show for her gallery and he has been courting such superstars as eric fischl susan rothenberg brice marden and sigmar polke his latest acquisition is francesco clemente the italian painter whose new work he will show uptown in the fall although questions have been raised about whether mr gagosian is too heavily leveraged his life style bespeaks affluence a dapper figure whose steel gray hair is styled in a power cut he wears the armani suits that are the uniform of the trade and like other big league dealers he is driven around in a limousine from which he works deals on a cellular phone he has a personal collection of abstract expressionism pop and the work of artists he represents an elegant town house on the upper east side of manhattan formerly owned by christophe de menil the fashion designer and schlumberger heiress and a spectacular modernist mansion overlooking the atlantic ocean in amagansett l i that was designed by the architect charles gwathmey for francois de menil christophes brother the guest lists at these homes include such luminaries as lee radziwill ross ronald s lauder the cosmetics heir and former united states ambassador to austria leo castelli the art dealer and peter m brant the newsprint magnate whose release from jail last december after time served for income tax evasion was celebrated with a dinner party chez gagosian but i think there is a certain gatsby quality to his life said one of his guests who spoke only on condition of anonymity he is still the outsider looking in determined to impress with his wealth and power in the last few years mr gagosian has taken steps to enhance his cultural image while at the same time cultivating star artists of the resale market he has earned critical kudos for a series of museum quality historical exhibitions focused on the earlier phases of the careers of such artists as brancusi cy twombly brice marden roy lichtenstein willem de kooning and frank stella seeking clients with power it is in his role as the most aggressive trader in the resale market however that mr gagosian has made his mark as a neophyte dealer in los angeles where he was born and grew up he lacked capital for an inventory of his own or to develop a stable of younger artists as he got to know the art world however he sensed the growing eagerness of collectors to trade up and turn over their artworks faster than was possible through auction houses or galleries he began to ferret out desirable pieces talking their owners into selling or trading then acting as middleman purveying them to other clients at commissions ranging from # to # percent i dont like to sell paintings to museums mr gagosian once told a fellow dealer because then i cant get them back often phoning prospects cold mr gagosian worked his way up to such resale clients as burton and emily tremaine from whose celebrated collection of post world war ii art he sold prizes like piet mondrians victory boogie woogie to mr newhouse for a price reported to be # million he also developed ties to mr saatchi whom he has represented in numerous deals in recent years he moved in a careful clear way sought out major collectors and saw who was buying and what said douglas cramer the television producer who is a longtime gagosian client he has a wonderful eye an encyclopedic memory and knows whats vulnerable to a trade but although mr gagosian receives high marks for hard work and a good eye some colleagues who have been involved in deals with him complain that they have been burned reports of deals gone bad a dealer who spoke only on condition of anonymity told of mr gagosians pressing him for a painting and a drawing by robert mangold for a certain client i sold him the mangolds because i wanted to get them into that collection the dealer said but i told him i needed to borrow the painting back later for a major show a couple of weeks later it turned up on the market he hadnt sold it to the collector at all now i wouldnt sell him anything in the way of new work asked about this case mr gagosian said it could have happened in any number of permutations but i dont recall it robert feldman the owner of parasol press which publishes original graphics and sells art only to dealers said that after several transactions with mr gagosian involving late payments and bounced checks in # he sold him a painting by robert ryman for # # knowing larry i took the precaution of getting a check from him before giving him the painting he said that same day mr feldman said the painting was returned with no explanation and mr gagosian had stopped payment on the check i figured he had a client for the work who turned out not to want it mr feldman said but mr gagosian hotly disputed mr feldmans version of the story he misrepresented the painting to me mr gagosian said he said it hadnt been on the market but the first client i called had been offered it before and for less money then i found it had been peddled all over the place at a lower price than what id paid so i called him and said i was sending it back he denied mr feldmans statement that the two had had unsatisfactory dealings he never had any problems with me mr gagosian said like a lot of other people he just seems to resent the fact that ive been a success mr feldman replied i made no representation to him as to whether the painting which i owned had been offered for sale before it was in fact brought to gagosians attention by the fred hoffman gallery in los angeles which had been told of it by the gallery tanit in munich so gagosian certainly knew that at least two other dealers were aware of the painting i never offered it to anyone at a lower price in fact i sold the painting after its return for more to another dealer nor did he despite what he said call me before he sent it back as for his denial that he had unsatisfactory dealings with me i will stand up in court with my records in the mid #s mr gagosian was engaged to catherine kerr formerly a dancer with the merce cunningham group ms kerr recalled that after the couple broke up he urged her to buy a drawing from jasper johns at that time artistic director of the cunningham company for mr gagosian to sell the idea was that i would ostensibly buy it but he would pay for it and then sell it ms kerr recalled i told him that i wouldnt do that mr gagosian said even though johns was artistic director of the company she didnt have that kind of access to him i might have said id like to meet him why dont you bring him to the gallery because at the time my own access was very limited i dont recall anything resembling her story but anyway theres nothing wrong with the scenario i wouldnt object to it debt managed with creativity as prices shot up in the #s helped by his own wheeling and dealing so did mr gagosians prestige in the late #s still living in california he bought a soho loft for # # and a brice marden painting and began to mount shows there including the work of david salle in # he moved his business from los angeles to new york impeccably renovating a ground level truck dock on west #d street in # he moved to the high rent district taking bigger quarters on the sixth floor of the former sotheby building at # madison avenue which he turned into a high tech space that projects a distinctly corporate image there he has a staff of # he is currently expanding his exhibition space to the floor below adding a huge gallery that will bring his total space to about # # square feet he also shares a gallery in soho at # thompson street with mr castelli and says that he will open another garage space in the fall reportedly at prince and wooster streets in soho for some time he had planned to open at # broadway but the space proved unsuitable for large scale sculpture despite these expansions mr gagosians finances continue to be a favorite topic of rumor and speculation in the art world public records in manhattan indicate that banks are holding as collateral liens on a number of of star paintings in his inventory including works by jackson pollock cy twombly sam francis roy lichtenstein brice marden frank stella barnett newman willem de kooning mark rothko and andy warhol some of the paintings under lien are worth millions of dollars like jackson pollocks scent a large oil dated # to # that dealers value today at about # million a spokesman for chemical bank which holds many of the liens refused to comment specifically on its dealings with mr gagosian but said that the bank did make loans and opened lines of credit to dealers based on the value of their inventories it is not customary practice to take liens on individual paintings the spokesman kenneth herz said but it is done selectively where works of art have a widely acknowledged market value he added it reflects well on someone if we have this kind of relationship because we feel he is a good businessman and has his finger on the pulse of the market nevertheless more conservative dealers avoid borrowing on their inventory a practice banks did not become widely involved in before the #s its aggressive on larrys part to leverage to this extent considering some of todays lowered price levels said a dealer who would speak only on condition of anonymity in todays softer market are these paintings still worth what mr gagosian paid for them in the #s i could sell one painting even at todays prices and pay off my entire obligation to the bank said mr gagosian who refused to discuss the amount of that obligation im at a level that is very comfortable for my business a transaction record filed in march in the new york city registry that mentions an assignment agreement between mr gagosian and mr saatch indicates that mr gagosian owes money to sothebys although the amount is not mentioned mr gagosian said he had an ongoing financial arrangement with the auction house but diana d brooks president of sothebys north america said the auction house had no blanket commitment to mr gagosian from time to time we have engaged in specific loan transactions with him she said in satisfaction of the loan mr gagosian said he had pledged some commissions due him from the sale of art owned by mr saatchi mitchell zuckerman president of sothebys financial services said the auction house had structured some financing for mr gagosian as it did for other dealers he informed us he was expecting payments from saatchi and so he redirected them to us mr zuckerman said mr gagosian says however ive got plenty of money business is still good although not as good as six months or a year ago i do have to work harder besides even though debt has become a dirty word after the #s a prudent use of it is the only way you can really grow i think in using various arrangements to sustain my business ive actually handled it rather creatively business friends but no backers mr saatchi a close friend is not a backer of his gallery mr gagosian said mr saatchi began to buy art from him some years ago when he was building his collection the dealer added he likes me and we get along well mr gagosian said i think he chose me to represent him because i had a feel for the art he was involved in and he thought i could do the job indeed in a relatively short time mr gagosian managed to sell a good deal of mr saatchis art at respectable prices and as one colleague put it without a lot of people knowing what had happened mr gagosian also has a close business and social relationship with mr newhouse the chairman of advance publications which owns random house inc and conde nast at an auction at sothebys in # at which mr gagosian bought jasper johnss false start for mr newhouse for # million the collector sat next to the dealer visibly instructing him on the bidding its no secret that we work together mr gagosian said his business and friendship are extremely important to me but both men deny that mr newhouse is mr gagosians backer there are moments when i wish i were mr newhouse said with a laugh the other day but im not in the business of running an art gallery i have no backers mr gagosian said the mantle and the stable that he would like to inherit in the art world is that of his closest dealer friend mr castelli who has helped build the careers of jasper johns robert rauschenberg frank stella roy lichtenstein and other artists who are today household names larry is very intelligent very enterprising and does wonderful shows besides having great business acumen mr castelli said if there is mutual admiration between the suave european born dealer and the brash californian there is also a symbiotic relationship mr gagosians high profits from the resale market have come in part from mr castellis long and arduous efforts to build the reputations of these now world famous artists on the other hand mr gagosians activities in that market have helped to boost the prices that mr castelli and others are able to charge for the artists newer work im more like leo than you think mr gagosian said and leos like me he laughed maybe if we were coming up together he wouldnt speak so kindly of me correction july #
