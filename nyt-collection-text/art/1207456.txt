on saturday the rothko chapel will reopen after an # month # # million renovation with the artists paintings newly restored perhaps rothkos greatest undertaking the chapel with its seven plum monochromes and seven so called black form paintings has probably never been closer to what he intended than it is now even the texture and color of the walls newly troweled with gray plaster is seductive the overall effect seems to illustrate a point made by david anfam a leading rothko scholar about one of what the artist called his dark pictures the painting he wrote proves the opposite of everything it seems at first to be not simple not monolithic not static not colorless but ambiguous organic crafty and sentient albeit only in the eyes of an observer who is willing to meet its dark demands although the paintings were finished in # the octagonal chapel commissioned by john and dominique de menil did not open until # the year after rothko committed suicide the timing made it easy to equate the somber paintings so different from the bright canvases rothko was known for with despair from the start the building which houses an ecumenical chapel with a focus on human rights had problems the lighting was never right the humidity could not be properly controlled at one point a blue tarp was stretched over the leaking central skylight to keep out the rain and a large crack appeared in the west wall when foundation problems caused half the chapel to sink more urgent the paintings themselves were exhibiting premature signs of age and the largest could not be removed for treatment originally installed through the skylight by a crane they were too big to fit through the door finding solutions was made more challenging by a commitment to preserve rothkos notoriously exacting vision it took seven years from # to # to complete the first treatment of the paintings in the process carol mancusi ungaro chief conservator of the menil collection gained an appreciation for the complexity of rothkos art that borders on reverence what she uncovered has lent momentum to a growing effort by scholars to change the common view that the dark pictures which began to appear in # are simply evidence of depression when ms mancusi ungaro was asked to look at a mysterious white film that began to appear on the black form paintings only a few years after the chapel opened almost nothing was known about how rothko actually made them after searching in vain for a conservator with the necessary expertise ms mancusi ungaro found one of rothkos assistants ray kelly who went to houston to demonstrate how the painter worked in the menil collection conservation lab mr kelly made small simulations of the black form paintings showing how rothko had mixed his own paint the black form paintings the largest of which is # by nearly nine feet consist of large hard edged black rectangles painted over muted rust red grounds with a narrow border of red left showing for the red as well as for the plum of the seven monochromes rothko used pigment dissolved in warm rabbit skin glue which produces a thin transparent wash of color the rectangles a velvety matte black turned out to be an egg oil emulsion a concoction of whole egg oil paint dammar resin and turpentine made fresh each day without a recipe although the contrast between the two kinds of paint appears subtle to viewers ms mancusi ungaro concluded that it was crucial to understanding the dark pictures the interplay of colors that was so important in rothkos paintings of the #s had given way not to morbidity she thought but to a more subtle interplay of surface qualities i think he was really moving on to something very sophisticated here in dealing with reflectances and the way light reflects off of a surface she said and thats what color is too but i think here he was going beyond dealing with how one perceives blackness and how one perceives borders the whiting on the other hand showed rothkos second preoccupation proportion because some areas were whiter than others ms mancusi ungaro concluded that they must have more layers of paint she knew rothko had worked out the size of the black rectangles with charcoal on paper pondering minute changes well into the night before having his assistants paint them on canvas the next day the whiting pattern which matched alterations rothko made to working sketches indicated that he made further revisions on canvas which would explain the faint pentimenti or traces that remained visible in the paint even after the whiting was removed the pentimenti were another clue they showed what kind of imperfections the great perfectionist would tolerate pia gottschaller who received a fellowship from the mellon foundation to work with ms mancusi ungaro on the restoration said they are there to a degree that made us think that rothko when he just finished them must have been able to see them and must have not minded for a time ms mancusi ungaro theorized that the whiting was caused by dammar resin which is known to blanch but when she scraped off a tiny sample and sent it to scientists at shell oil laboratories they determined that it was composed of fatty acids probably from egg yolk that had migrated to the paintings surface with the help of houstons humidity even if the whiting were removed once it would probably reappear with the help of the shell scientists and another conservator andrea di bagno ms mancusi ungaro came up with a chemical solvent to treat the paintings they turned them on their sides the way they were when rothko painted them in a choreographed process one woman would run a large piece of cotton batting dipped in solvent across the painting with a smooth even stroke and the other would follow with another piece of cotton wiping it dry the treatment worked and in # the paintings were reinstalled in time for the opening of the menil collection a nearby museum also built by mrs de menil by the mid #s however the whiting had returned just as ms mancusi ungaro took care to preserve rothkos surfaces once she realized their importance the engineering team that worked on the lighting rejected simple solutions for fear they would alter the artists vision when the chapel opened a curtain of sunlight overpowered the paintings the easy answer was to stretch a diffusing scrim over the skylight but the menil team thought it was important to preserve a sense of time passing the light inside had to be reduced but it still had to change with the position of the sun we could not change what rothko knew to be the chapel said paul winkler director of the menil collection until last year mrs de menil hired ove arup partners the london engineering firm that worked on the menil collection and the nearby cy twombly pavilion both of which are noted for their use of natural light after years of study the engineers designed a compact baffle with a hole in the middle that fits up into the skylight in early # the chapel closed for a major renovation the baffle was installed along with a new climate control system that should slow the whiting process the sinking foundation was shored up by # foot piers before work began however contractors knocked a hole in the wall so the paintings could be taken to ms mancusi ungaros lab for treatment in addition to removing the whiting again ms mancusi ungaro and ms gottschaller fixed some problems that may have been caused by early conservation attempts those early treatments ms mancusi ungaro emphasizes highlight how uncharted the territory of conservation is usually painting conservators can use varnish to hide irregularities in their work but rothkos paintings like many of his time were not intended to be varnished working with monochromatic paintings conservators dont have a lot of guidelines as to what we can accept ms mancusi ungaro said and its not just conservators its the art profession at large that has not really established a consensus of acceptable aging whats more she pointed out there are people who remember what the paintings looked like brand new they look at the smallest problem and they think the picture is ruined that happens in every generation im sure people felt the same way when they saw the cracks in the rembrandts arts in america
