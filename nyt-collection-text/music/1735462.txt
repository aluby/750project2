the c m a awards country musics biggest night as the ads branded it found manhattan overrun by nashville music biz types for a week in november and while platinum acts like trace adkins and brad paisley rehearsed for a special grand ole opry broadcast just around the corner at carnegie hall jenny lewis sat in a greek restaurant chatting over beet salad she was in town promoting her first solo record titled rabbit fur coat a set of country style story songs filled with gospel harmonies and verses about god the timing however was purely coincidental i find most modern country virtually unlistenable said ms lewis who will not be singing duets with kenny chesney anytime soon i cant relate to the music or the lyrics but i grew up on loretta lynn and dusty springfield i remember lying about it it wasnt cool to listen to country when i was # ultimately though my voice and the songs i did with rilo kiley were revealing i had to fess up to being a country fan ms lewiss day job remains lead singer for rilo kiley the indie rock band whose # album more adventurous topped many critics best of lists as well as that of elvis costello who said it showed the best lyric writing ive heard in many a day the recording which sold more than # # copies was a breakthrough first it showed ms lewis coming of age as a writer she wrote about half its songs the most memorable ones the southern soul doppelg nger i never and the adultery narrative does he love you predicting the direction of her solo debut it also aligned the band with a major label warner brothers and helped spur a string of arena dates opening for the megaband coldplay yet ms lewis has released rabbit fur coat on the team love label run by her friend conor oberst the singer songwriter who performs as bright eyes one of the only reasons i made this record when i did was because a couple of years ago conor asked me to she said at the time it didnt make sense but i was honoring that moment and teams support of artists in general i didnt know i could do it until he asked me thats the funny thing when someone you really admire puts faith in you and ultimately dollar bills it counts for a lot a petite woman with understated features and a spectacular mane of red hair ms lewis # is one of indie rocks strongest female personalities she is often referred to as the scenes queen or at least princess and she walks like she talks it she wears oversized sunglasses but with an attitude of irony and mentions a thrift store in detroit as the source of a striking purple knit dress shes wearing i got three in different colors exuding a blend of self possession and self effacement she alternates snappy retorts with worried confessions as if acting the role of the skeptical indie artiste which makes sense the singers performing career began as a child actress in los angeles where she did everything from a jell o commercial to decidedly sub classic movies like troop beverly hills and big girls dont cry they get even she doesnt regard that career as training for this one i was an actress not a writer and not a very good actress she said this has more to do with bobbie gentry but she still likes to act the photos in the cd booklet could be stills from an early robert altman film ms lewis wearing a scarlet dress haunts a budget hotel with a young child and a pair of adult twins in matching turquoise blouses and eye shadow the photographs suggest a meta narrative for lyrics involving familiar los angeles themes like adultery cocaine use cosmetic surgery and house arrest while the child in the photos is not ms lewiss the women are the watson twins leigh and chandra her musical collaborators on rabbit fur coat the group performs next sunday at the angel orensanz center in manhattan for all the southern influences on her record ms lewiss main inspiration was more northern laura nyro and labelles # collection of brill building and motown classics gonna take a miracle ms lewis thought the watsons whom she met in los angeles through her band mate and ex boyfriend blake sennett would be perfect at that style of gospel flavored backing vocals they agreed the twins who will release their debut this month southern manners hail from louisville ky where they grew up singing in church choirs and admiring r b singers like candi staton they say they especially like ms lewiss lyrics which invoke god and the devil often in surprising ways the old time gospel of run devil run and the new age soul of raise up with fists suggest a familiar struggle to do right in a dirty world while the wickedly jaunty the charging sky presents a disbelieving free associating narrator who prays as insurance and wonders what if gods not there but his name is on your dollar bill which just became cab fare ms lewis who is jewish by birth although everyone assumes im a little shiksa she says and currently lives alone in los angeles said the religious inquiries on rabbit fur coat partly reflect her own spiritual musings god hes a funny guy she said im not a religious person by any means but im curious and most of the time i feel really left out in the religious slash political climate of the country these days like am i really missing out here everyone seems so completely faithful and so happy about it trying to imagine herself into the heads of religious believers as kindred singers steve earle and dar williams have in recent songs was also a way out of writing strictly about herself although ms lewis coyly suggests rabbit fur coat is all autobiographical in the end that even extends to her remarkable cover of the traveling wilburys handle with care one of her all time favorite songs she gave the parts originally sung by bob dylan tom petty roy orbison jeff lynne and george harrison to her fellow indie rock stars ben gibbard m ward and mr oberst who having long been billed as a new dylan gets to ape him here the song is a marvelous mirror of a classic right down to mr gibbards shimmering # string guitar work but being a bona fide writer now ms lewis elected to alter the lyrics just slightly replacing fobbed in harrisons line ive been fobbed off with a more familiar expletive its rough to take liberties with a song thats perfect she said but fobbed i tried but i just couldnt sing it it made me laugh every time rabbit fur coat jenny lewis with the watson twins team love records in stores now music
