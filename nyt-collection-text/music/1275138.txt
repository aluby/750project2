on a recent afternoon the sound of a scarlatti sonata accompanied by energetic whistling drifted down a nondescript hallway in the murray hill section of manhattan the music was courtesy of the choreographer mark morris who stood in the doorway of his modest apartment which is being renovated his boxes of books and his lovingly jumbled collection of objects have no place to rest but mr morris is never without music whether played on records whistled or as part of the musical yardage that runs constantly through his head the mark morris dance groups #th anniversary season will begin on tuesday when the company returns to mr morriss favorite new york theater the howard gilman opera house at the brooklyn academy of music mr morriss company of about # dancers will soon move into its new home across the street in a building that is also under construction the bam program opens with falling down stairs and other dances it closes on march # with mr morriss # evening length lallegro il penseroso ed il moderato widely acknowledged as his masterwork and the subject of a book of the same name marlowe company possibly the most exhaustive examination of a single dance work ever published the most eagerly anticipated of the # dances the morris company will perform is the new york premiere of his # minute adaptation of four saints in three acts the legendary opera by gertrude stein and virgil thomson the operas ebullience and all american outrageousness suit mr morris perfectly it is exultant celebratory he says in steins version of heaven nothing happens its just fabulous all the time mr morris who is # heard the operas most famous passage pigeons on the grass alas in his late adolescence and was immediately intrigued he lost no time in finding thomsons # rca victor abridged recording the version he is using with some additions of his own but mostly he knew the # minute opera by its reputation when it was first produced in # four saints received more press attention than any other american cultural event of the era such unlikely fascination with an avant garde work was fueled by the revolutionary practice of casting african americans in an opera by the mania for stein in the wake of her best selling autobiography of alice b toklas and by the chic buzz coming from high bohemia as a succ s de scandale its first performances at the wadsworth atheneum in hartford ranked alongside the armory show le sacre du printemps or george antheils ballet m chanique after it moved to broadway for a six week run a record for an opera porgy and bess surpassed it a few years later four saints fell into a long period of invisibility among major companies despite periodic talk of revivals in # robert wilson directed the first large scale production in more than # years it was musically impeccable mr morris says but i thought the production was static then came his brainstorm he would choreograph a danced version of the opera about an hour coupled with his # danced version of dido and aeneas henry purcells hourlong opera the resulting pairing which had its premiere in london last june starred two of mr morriss new dancers john heginbotham and michelle yard in saints and the two oldest himself and guillermo resto in dido the juxtaposition of operas and performers reflected two different periods in the morris company and two different eras in opera in brooklyn four saints will be staged with lou harrisons # work world power mr morris says he steeped himself in four saints and its creators cheered on by his friend the librettist and poet alice goodman he tackled such forbidding stein works as tender buttons and a novel of thank you he read thomsons autobiography finding it mendacious fabulous witty and perfectly complemented by anthony tommasinis recent biography composer on the aisle he studied thomsons score and in its mock simplicity he found an energetic pastiche of hymns both black and white scary fairground marches plainchant and eastern orthodox chant its accumulative and wonderful the way it stacks up because it is so seemingly simple and basic mr morris says it has the exact cadence of american conversation and the chords he repeats most often # # and # are the same as those in rock n roll and gospel mr morriss dance which is performed to live music with eight soloists and a chorus in the pit with the orchestra evokes characters and even presents a relationship between the central figures st teresa and st ignatius the historical figures actually lived in different centuries st teresa pursued a private relationship with god through hermeticism while st ignatius was buoyed by missionary gregariousness and their different drives one inward one outward are reflected in mr morriss choreography such important principal roles are rare in a company devoted largely to ensemble dances the joke in the company is that a giant solo is about four bars long mr morris says its very strict musically and choreographically the effect is that it looks improvised like a spontaneous emanation you are not waiting to be led by music or accompanied by music you are music its a little trick and thats the way i choose to work extensive research has gone into his choreography his version of spain for example is evoked by quick quotations from regional folk dances a jota a sevillana a farruca a sardana stein described her libretto as a landscape and mr morris describes his choreography as very weathery its filled with night and day windy and calm dry and wet he says you cant just have exultation you have to build to it there is a calm before the storm also in the eye of the storm mr morris faces inevitable comparisons with the original production of four saints in three acts he chose not to follow thomsons # plan to cast the work entirely with african americans for that would suggest something quite different in # but he incorporated a variety of the african american movement vocabulary that was part of thomsons world high stepping cakewalking and vaudeville dance when frederic ashton created the operas dances in # he called them a mixture of snake hips and gothic those who recall florine stettheimers otherworldly sets of cellophane and feather trees will be surprised by the simplicity of the current d cor mr morris initially envisioned four saints populated with elaborate props like a picassoid guitar flowers and disposable cameras but he gradually stripped all such extras away employing the low tech approach that characterizes many of his productions once when asked what were the most important qualities in a choreographer mr morris replied imagination and knowing when to stop just because you think its interesting doesnt mean it actually is interesting he ended up with four sunny flats painted by maira kalman one for each act the operas title misstates the number of both the saints more than a dozen and the acts complemented by a front drop curtain covered with steins text looking back on the two decades of his company mr morris says years ago i would have kept more of those props i would have been more florid now just a single prop remains a simple swing downstage to evoke heaven steven watson is the author of prepare for saints gertrude stein virgil thomson and the mainstreaming of american modernism correction march # # sunday an article last sunday about the choreographer mark morriss adaptation of the virgil thomson opera four saints in three acts which has its new york premiere this week at the brooklyn academy of music misspelled the given name of the choreographer of the operas original dances in #
