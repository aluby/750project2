is it simply a coincidence or could it be a cabal three of the foremost british directors are working on broadway at the same time readying major american shows to face new york audiences this month richard eyre is opening a revival of the crucible tonight nicholas hytners production of the new musical sweet smell of success opens on march # and trevor nunns remounting of his acclaimed royal national theater production of oklahoma opens on march # these men have many things in common beginning with the fact that each represents a past present or future artistic director of the royal national theater in london each is well aware of the artistic and royal lineage at the national the baton passing from lord olivier to sir peter hall sir richard eyre sir trevor nunn and as yet mr hytner who takes over the post next year for several weeks each of the three was in rehearsal with his show in the same building the duke on #nd street they would often pass one another in hallways old home week for the visiting britons as liam neeson portraying john proctor cried out in defense of his good name in #th century salem in other rooms patrick wilson sauntered across the rehearsal stage singing oh what a beautiful mornin and john lithgow as the cynical newspaper columnist j j hunsecker sang a salute to his profession welcome to the night in individual interviews the directors expressed a particular enthusiasm for american shows while speaking about their own roles at the national mr eyre and mr nunn are doing the crucible and oklahoma because they are contemporary american classics having done his share of revivals mr hytner was quite simply attracted to the challenge of doing a new american musical on broadway although their careers have overlapped each has a clear directorial identity the first show that mr eyre directed on the olivier stage at the national was guys and dolls and he is also known in england for directing plays by david hare he was the chief creative force behind changing stages a book and television series about the english theater his most recent film is iris for which dame judi dench has been nominated for an oscar mr nunn who was three years ahead of mr eyre at cambridge university was the artistic director of the royal shakespeare company for many years and is known equally for his shakespearean productions for nicholas nickleby which he directed with john caird and for his collaboration with andrew lloyd webber he wrote the lyrics for memory in cats which he directed both he and mr eyre have staged plays by tom stoppard at # mr hytner is the youngest and the one with the strongest new york connection having directed carousel and twelfth night at lincoln center where he is an associate director of the theater company he has often staged the work of alan bennett and filmed mr bennetts madness of king george as well as the crucible he also directed miss saigon mr hytner said that mr eyre gave him his first opportunity to direct at the national they have remained friends and had dinner together in new york mr nunn was usually on the run and at one point returned briefly to london mr eyre and mr nunn will probably continue to direct at the national when mr hytner is in charge also along with sir peter they will be available as ex directors of the national who know where all the bodies are buried mr hytner said discussing their common backgrounds and interests mr hytner said were all creatures of subsidized theater each has also had considerable success in commercial theater were always looking for ways of reconciling the seductive hustle of the american musical with the high seriousness of european art theater he said while leaving room for english plays classic and modern explaining why classic american musicals seem to be even more popular in england than in the united states mr hytner said one of the great strengths of the american theater is that it has always been less interested in reinvestigation and revival than in creating the new mr hytners reference was not just to broadway which specializes in revivals but to the broad range of the american theater in england our culture looks back all the time he continued it seems to me the great challenge of running the national is to discover new work perhaps more than his predecessors that will be high on his agenda much higher than shakespeare in contrast to his revival of carousel a new musical like sweet smell of success is more of a high wire act he said after trying out in chicago the show by marvin hamlisch craig carnelia and john guare has gone through revisions in new york before opening on broadway mr eyre said categorically the american musical is the only original dramatic form to be created in the #th century and he emphasized it is a uniquely american creation he continued for # or # years it was an art form in a state of grace it produced a series of masterpieces in the same way as puccini and verdi in #th century opera he said that growing up in the #s he thought that everything about american culture was better than british plays novels films music his kinship with the united states extends to drama in particular to the works of arthur miller and tennessee williams and he praised their writing for its passion and muscularity as he said most american plays tend to be about the american dream or the corollary the failure of the american dream about utopianism and idealism corrupted if youre marinated in shakespeare and looking for a classic continuum you certainly lean more to people who seem to have swum in the same water than you do to the etiolated british playwrights for me coward is nails down a blackboard more recent british playwrights including harold pinter alan ayckbourn mr stoppard and mr hare are exempted from that charge and have been staged at the national through various regimes in their work at the national both mr eyre and mr nunn have explored americas theatrical past plays as well as musicals including many by stephen sondheim some london critics have objected to mr nunn presenting such lavish productions of american shows south pacific followed my fair lady at the olivier on the other hand new american writers have not often been produced in london in response mr nunn said if we started to do a great deal more american drama we would be criticized for becoming the national theater of america mr nunns next major work will be mr stoppards trilogy about russia before the revolution scheduled to open this summer in articulating his feelings about theater mr nunn looks back to his cambridge days and his studies with f r leavis this great literary critic believed that absolute standards in artistic matters were definable that a matter of opinion would not do he would say that the way we progress is to ask the question this is so isnt it and we expect the reply yes but the but is all important what richard passed on to me was something about which i could say yes but and i believe thats what i will pass on to nick the national under nick will have a very defined personality as is clear from all his creative work up to now reflecting on his run at the national mr nunn said that heading such a theater takes diplomacy patience and sometimes a degree of unpopularity to get things to work but what it takes most of all is good luck having been freed for the last four years from the nationals obligations mr eyre is tempted by the idea of directing a company again i sort of think i will because i love doing it he said adding that he missed his meetings with artists he had chosen to work with and also missed that feeling of adventure in contrast mr nunn said that having run two major companies the national and the royal shakespeare huge huge labyrinthine tentacular organizations he is not eager to run another one for him too much time had to be devoted to being a producer rather than a director when he concludes his five year tenure he plans to return to being a freelance director as for mr hytner he is looking ahead to his new position i cant think of anything that would be better to do this is the best job thats available to a director in the english speaking theater he said he was tantalized by the idea that in a few years there will be people who feel that their lives and careers owe as much to me as i owe to richard eyre correction march #
