beethoven symphonies nos # # minnesota orchestra conducted by osmo vanska bis sacd # cd so why should anyone want yet another beethoven symphony cd why do we listen to beethoven anyway this recording offers an answer or rather a lot of them we listen because beethoven offers suspense action humor delight not that the finnish conductor osmo vanska deliberately aims at these effects instead they arise from a clear swift stream of music that does full justice to the force and power of the score without aggression or artifice from the start of the fourth you cant not listen as the somber introduction masses the orchestras forces a sense of pink pantherish humor lurks behind the music something is about to happen but what yet the explosive release of the main theme when it comes is more than just a punch line it opens a new door emotionally in this pairing it also presages the climactic transition from the third movement of the fifth to the finale where the whole orchestra shines in majestic joy without appearing at all self important this is something that mr vanska excels at over and over here creating a sense of impending event then delivering even more than he promised his deft control of the orchestra is just icing on the cake the orchestra sounds full and clear with particularly fine woodwinds mr vanska it happens is a clarinetist recorded with great specificity of timbre solo instruments sound like the very essence of themselves its refreshing to hear a strong reading of beethoven that isnt riddled with angst or the seriousness of it all not that this sunny disk is at all superficial it is instead a reminder that good music is simply music in which interesting things happen in a way that people can hear and want to hear anne midgette music classical recordings
