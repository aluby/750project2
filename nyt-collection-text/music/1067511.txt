to the editor it was nice to see peter keepnews give credit to the bandleaders who brighten up the talk show circuit with witty musical choices mr keepnews though wrote that the idea of picking relevant song titles seems to have originated with paul shaffer back in the early days of mr lettermans late night show surely mr keepnews is familiar with the band fronted by the drummer bobby rosengarden for the dick cavett show in the early #s as a teen aged saxophone player at the time i paid close attention any time the band played rosengarden was more subtle and humorous in his choices than much of what you hear on todays talk shows my favorite was the entrance for a sex therapist guest the band played ira gershwin and vernon dukes i cant get started david statter falls church va late night bands
