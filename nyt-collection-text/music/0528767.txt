 split and slide a song written by butch hancock is the kind of tale that folklore is made of it chronicles the rise and fall of two crazy characters from west texas whose exploits and misadventures take them through small towns into sleazy gambling joints up and down mountains and in and out of love at one point they try to rob a bank and wind up being hauled away on the back of a garbage truck split and slide are contented losers no matter how many times they fail to get ahead theyre always happy to try again at the end of one chapter of the saga theyre back to playing music in their dumpy hometown cafe plotting a new way to escape out the swinging screen door mr hancock and steve young two southern singers and songwriters who will perform tonight at cbs gallery in manhattan and tomorrow night at maxwells in hoboken n j are a kind of real life split and slide both have been playing country folk music troubadour style for more than # years neither has had much commercial success and neither seems to care greatly mr hancock grew up in lubbock tex and lives in austin where he has his own store performance space and gallery called lubbock or leave it a kind of modest mecca of austin folk culture mr young has been recording solo albums since # and has lived in georgia alabama los angeles nashville and now austin the pair have been on tour together since last month were veterans of the road mr young said in a recent phone interview from a stop in westboro mass butch has a jeep cherokee were just out there putting miles on it mr hancock got on the phone and said good morning even though it was # oclock at night both singers treat music not as a career but as a life style they dont abide by the rules of the music business and as a result have remained outsiders their songs like mr hancocks split and slide or mr youngs seven bridges road are highly literate artful narratives about the romance of life on the fringes of society each sings with the grace and flair of a modern bard as performers theyre less anomalies than they are proud bearers of the oral folk tradition mr young was born on july # # he grew up in georgia alabama and east texas absorbing what he terms the music of the south i heard music from the baptist church where i was made to go to for a while he said i heard mountain music a lot of people that influenced me were anonymous street singers in little towns usually black people but not always i heard bluegrass bands i also listened to the radio people like hank snow to hank williams until elvis came along and blew it all out of the water when he was in his late teens mr young bought a # buick and drove it to new york where he absorbed the greenwich village folk scene in # he went to los angeles and began working in different bands and as a session guitarist by the end of the decade he was involved with the growing country rock movement and released his solo debut rock salt and nails on a m records with guest appearances by gram parsons of the flying burrito brothers and gene clark of the byrds mr young said people didnt really know what to think of this music a m said hey this is country music and they sent it to nashville nashville said we dont think its country music we dont know what it is throughout the #s and #s mr young bounced around major and independent labels reprise rca nashville mountain railroad rounder in # waylon jennings had a country hit with mr youngs song lonesome ornry and mean the eagles recorded seven bridges road mr youngs latest album solo live was released last year on the austin based label watermelon i never was a good ole boy he said i just was not a conformist i like to be the outsider the lone wolf ive told people that if i had my way i would only play one place one time i would never go back just try to have a good night and then let it go briefly a band mr hancock was born july # # his father was a farmer and contractor on the west texas plains and mr hancock has said his first songs came to him while driving his dads tractor around # he fell in with a group of songwriters musicians and metaphysical vagrants that included joe ely and jimmie dale gilmore with their friends steve wesson and tony pearson they formed the flatlanders being brought up in lubbock all of us kind of drifted by osmosis to the same place in society which tended to be the outsiders mr hancock said we had this great house called #th street it was one of those bizarre places where people would come in and sleep for a few days and leave and nobody could figure out who they were i thought they were your friends i thought they were yours the band soon drifted apart a flatlanders album more a legend than a band was issued posthumously on rounder records although mr ely and mr gilmore both have current major label contracts mr hancock has never been offered one except for a compilation own and own on sugar hill records his recordings have been issued on his own rainlight label his most recent project was a # cassette release no two alike recorded over six nights at an austin club and including # of mr hancocks songs from split and slide and west texas waltz to boxcars and split and slide ii the second chapter of the saga mr hancocks lyrics are drawn as much from his experiences in texas as from his sojourns all over the country and around the world were constantly hypnotized and influenced by our environment he said one time the flatlanders were hanging out in the tower of pizza in austin you know a boring little old tower of pizza we all decided to see how bored we could get and it wound up having exactly the opposite effect we were all laughing hysterically within minutes we could not get bored no matter how hard we tried i travel to all kinds of crazy places from the most apparently boring to the apparently exciting he continued everything is adventurous butch hancock and steve young will perform tonight at cbs gallery # bowery at bleecker street in the east village show time is # p m tickets are # information # # # tomorrows concert at maxwells # washington street in hoboken is at # p m tickets are # information # # #
