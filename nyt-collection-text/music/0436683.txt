danny gatton the ritz # east #th street tuesday nights show at the ritz featuring the guitarist danny gatton and the new orleans band the radiators was meant to be a night of american bar band music but turned out to be a night of sloppiness instead mr gatton an extraordinary guitarist who has developed a strong following opened the show by enveloping a handful of musical styles with the assault of his clanging guitar american pop music is often formal but it runs on strong doses of anarchy mr gatton who knows most of the american vernacular guitar styles blues country rock and some jazz is more than willing to push the limits of the genres he fools with his improvisations sprayed out notes in clumps let loose silvery runs that ended in bursts of shrill shrieks and used a beer bottle to draw a harsh scream from the guitar but mr gatton isnt a great band leader and he and his band plodded along through blues and standards at numbingly high volume the show closed with the radiators a mediocre bar band that tried some elemental group improvisation that at times seemed empathetic and supple as it did with mr gatton the ritzs sound system turned the radiators music into a clotted mess but even that couldnt hide the routine mid #s approach to rock earnest slightly regional and competent enough to form the background music for a saturday night party
