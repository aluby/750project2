with the three bands that played at the mercury lounge on monday night there was no telling which comes first the song or the sound that envelops it the dandy warhols polara and swoon # all reach back to the velvet undergrounds primal art punk fusion of drone tune and noise around simple structures they gather resonances and dissonances making songs throb or ripple or screech the dandy warhols from portland ore started their set with eight minutes of one chord over a steady ticking drumbeat strumming it into crescendos letting keyboard glissandos dive through it and quietly intoning keep on doing what youre doing from there the band moved into songs that drew on three chord rock and early psychedelia using serene vocal harmonies buzzing keyboard licks and poppy choruses of la la and ba ba ba bop the bands #s twist is its lyrics which are sardonic about their own alienation one song sneers i never thought youd be a junkie because heroin is so passe but the words are carried away in sheer sound which swallows any pettiness in the richness of resonating chords polara from minneapolis is scrappier a garage band unraveling at the edges ed ackerson its leader writes and sings relatively straightforward songs about love and frustration true to collegiate rock style mr ackerson translates ambivalence into sonic tumult songs emerged from drones and ended in feedback between verses he made his guitar notes wah wah and wriggle but chaos never overwhelmed the tunes which made a short set seem even shorter swoon # also from portland ore is one of many bands among them mazzy star and elysian fields indebted to the velvet undergrounds songs with nico swoon # floats megan pickerels breathy voice over slow tolling chords seeking and usually finding a sense of ominous foreboding and timeless uncertainty in their brooding repetition pop review
