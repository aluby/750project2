george benson blue note when the guitarist george benson drifted into the pop jazz world in the early #s his records were fascinating because they were so loaded with inside jokes mr benson was playing instrumental pop music for people who didnt particularly want to be bothered with the complexities of improvisation mr benson an exceptional guitarist with a complicated harmonic palette always included runs and lines that flashed how much he knew adding an intentional tension to his projects that tension between the desire to please a crowd with simple music and a jazz musicians desire to exercise the imagination should have vanished in mr bensons recent pairing with the count basie orchestra but it hasnt mr bensons performance at the blue note on tuesday night backed by the orchestra was authentic schmaltz pure grinning disingenuousness at the end of the performance mr benson introducing the rhythm section as if hed known them half his life had frank foster the leader of the orchestra whispering their names to him as he announced them mr benson simply isnt that good in the role of good time bound for vegas entertainer theres always something slightly frozen about his performances the role demands being able to make people believe in your sincerity something mr benson hasnt quite got the hang of which isnt to say mr benson doesnt have real talent hes still an extraordinary guitarist and a more than decent singer on tunes like on green dolphin street mambo inn and i only have eyes for you he crooned the melodies in a way that made them all excursions into optimistic pop music it was on his short guitar improvisations that mr bensons abilities came through on mambo inn he slid up and down into notes and turned the simple harmonies into a backdrop for his own harmonic imagination moving from blues dissonances to darker harmonies and percussive chordal explosions mr benson was virtuosic but the context deprived his playing of much significance by the end of the hour and a half show it was clear that once ones soul has been sold to commerce its impossible to get it back
