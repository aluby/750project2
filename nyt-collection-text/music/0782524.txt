the music history texts usually cite the german composer karlheinz stockhausen as the pioneer of spatial music music that uses the space between separated groups of instruments as a defining compositional component but the american experimental composer henry brant was there first his breakthrough spatial work antiphony # from # predates stockhausens more intellectually touted gruppen by five years and ever since mr brant like some compositional ringmaster has been gathering large groups of people together in public spaces and surrounding them with strategically positioned batteries of instruments and sound producing gadgets mr brant was at it again on sunday evening at damrosch park at lincoln center where dormant craters his latest spatial composition a one movement # minute work for # percussionists commissioned by lincoln center for its out of doors festival was given its premiere like mr brants other spatial pieces dormant craters comes in a direct line from charles ives who as a boy loved to hear the way the sounds of outdoor bands and carousels and crowd noise would mingle as he stood in the center of a public square ives tried to evoke this riotous mix of sounds in his compositions so does mr brant who unlike stockhausen favors mixing stylistically different elements dormant craters presented an abundance of defiantly low tech unamplified nonelectronic sounds there were two jazz drummers panama francis and warren i smith a gamelan ensemble gamelan son of lion a steel drum group pandemonium steelband timpani chimes galore glockenspiel cowbells chinese wood blocks bass drums snare drums all played by the pulse percussion ensemble and a gadget fair of everyday items kitchen pan covers tin pots saws the performers wore crazily mismatched outfits exotic dresses ponchos costumes pieced together from greenwich village thrift shops mr brant a spry # who conducted made his fashion statement in baggy red pants with matching suspenders and a plum purple shirt yet dormant craters was not just a lark every bit of the score was notated by mr brant though coordinations between the various groups are sometimes allowed to be approximate given the size of the assembled forces the music was often surprisingly delicate and distinct sputterings of wood blocks and choruses of softly chiming bells would alternate with rat a tat drum riffs outbursts of timpani and clashing onslaughts of metallic noise the occasional sounds of trucks air breaking to a stop on west #d street and overhead helicopters seemed not intrusions but part of the ambiance whether dormant craters will be a lasting contribution to music history was probably the last thing on mr brants mind on its title page the work is called a spatial event and an event it was but if a compositions communicative power can be measured by the audiences attentiveness then dormant craters was a success the audience was large diverse and involved many people remained to hear the repeat performance this was not a time for pronouncements about a compositions importance just being there listening you felt like a participant music review
