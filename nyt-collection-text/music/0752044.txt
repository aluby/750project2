a scandal at sunset a scandal involving sunset boulevard box office figures shocked broadway this week and led to a resignation offer by edgar dobie the head of north american operations for the really useful group sir andrew lloyd webbers production company sir andrew released a letter yesterday saying that he was refusing mr dobies resignation but it took a rather paternalistic tone sir andrew distanced himself from mr dobies decision to inflate box office figures even calling it idiotic that may leave mr dobie little choice but to quit the fuss began when jeremy gerard writing in daily variety obtained a ticketmaster box office statement for march # to # the first week glenn close was on a previously announced vacation and replaced by her understudy karen mason it said the show had sold # # worth of tickets that was # # less than the show had reported to variety which prints weekly box office figures for all broadway shows variety usually gets its figures from theater owners but sunset insisted on providing its own the implication in mr gerards article on wednesday was that really useful was trying to show falsely that sunset could thrive without ms close which will be a crucial issue when she leaves for good in july that day mr dobie released a letter explaining the discrepancy and apologizing because sunset had # # tickets available during ms closes two week vacation he said it passed many of them to worthy organizations like the theater development fund which makes them available at deep discounts to the elderly students and the handicapped but it reported those tickets as sold at full value however broadway shows routinely get rid of excess tickets that way or send them to the tkts booth and they account for the discounting instead of disguising the figures mr dobie did not respond to phone calls yesterday a spokesman for sir andrew said he believed that sir andrew did not intend to force mr dobie to resign but would not comment further carol burnett fades back in carol burnett plans to return to broadway this fall for the first time in #

was legendary not just because she was a hit as she was in once upon a mattress but because the show became one of the messiest most litigious chapters in theater history according to press reports from the time the producers lester osterman and the composer jule styne accused her of expensively delaying the show with a surprise pregnancy faking neck injuries and colds to miss # of the first # performances and trying to get out of her contract because television studios were pursuing her she created her own emmy winning show four years later miss burnett counterattacked wearing a neck brace at news conferences and releasing a letter saying im sorry i got sick im sorry the play had to close because i was sick im sorry you dont think im sick ultimately through lawsuits and actors equity arbitration hearings they forced her back to the stage and reopened the show but it ran only # more performances before miss burnett informed the producers that she had hurt her neck again was pregnant again and was confined to bed a week after the closing she broke her ankle playing softball asked about the battle yesterday she said thats all water under the bridge im not the same person i was then im not the same person i was five years ago elizabeth williams the lead producer of moon over buffalo said she didnt know the history but wasnt worried she produced love letters in los angeles with miss burnett without a hitch two faces in jekyll hyde jekyll hyde has an eye catching logo with a starched shirt front whetted down into a dagger at the heroines throat and now it has plans for a national tour that may make a lunge at broadway in time to qualify for tony contention in #
