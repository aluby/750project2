perched five stories above columbus circle in the time warner center rafael vi olys new design for jazz at lincoln center has a cool ethereality that lifts it above the mediocrity of its setting its a reminder that some experiences become more intimate when they are shared in full public view the complex measuring # # square feet has three performance spaces the # # seat rose theater the # seat allen room and dizzys club coca cola and a jazz hall of fame the beauty of these spaces lies in their emotional range the most stunning the allen room opens onto a dazzling view of manhattans midtown skyline the largest the rose is more insular while dizzys club has a cozy informality whats so surprising is that all three arose in the context of one of the citys most convoluted and lifeless recent development projects jazz at lincoln center was conceived as just one component of time warners massive retail office project overseen by the related companies the developer and designed by david childs of skidmore owings merrill mr childs designed the projects retail and commercial spaces while mr vi oly oversaw the design of the jazz center the architects had to negotiate the relationship between the spaces mr vi olys complex rests on top of the time warner centers shops and restaurants a soulless mall that has the feel of a mausoleum conceived by mr childs as a series of identical floors on the first four stories that frame a vast glass atrium overlooking columbus circle and #th street the malls uniform spaces clad in expensive looking gray granite and glass are a vision of suburban ennui even the view of the city experienced from a series of balconies that are pulled back from the main facade seems detached the sterile result is a conventional development formula an efficient trap for consumers mr vi oly obviously wanted to isolate his project from the one below and link it closely to the vibrancy of the city outside at various points he and mr childs discussed creating a series of escalators that would run straight from the malls main atrium to the lobby of jazz at lincoln center mr vi oly also tried in vain to negotiate direct access from the street eventually they settled on a compromise a bank of elevators set just inside the malls entry at broadway and #th street this entry has the advantage of allowing visitors to sneak by the malls depressing warren of shops the elevators rise directly to the jazz centers fifth floor lobby the ertegun jazz hall of fame is tucked to one side of this designed by the rockwell group the long narrow room is enclosed behind pivoting cork clad walls that open so people can drift in directly from a corridor leading to the restrooms and entrances to the theaters the halls undulating wood ceiling and plush carpeting decorated in a brown and beige geometric pattern are a clich of #s style the rest of the lobby designed by mr vi oly is dominated by a large oddly shaped events space with a window that yields your first glimpse of the midtown skyline and the trees of central park photographs of jazz performers line the walls in a nod to the developers desire to tap into the jazz centers clientele the escalators here lead down to the malls fourth floor restaurants the lobby areas which feel as if they have been carved out of the malls leftover spaces would be at home in a neighborhood cineplex but at least they avoid the pretentious middlebrow posturing of the granite clad retail areas below their informality suits the centers mission to make jazz accessible it is best however to ignore these spaces and retreat into the theaters the allen room alone justifies the torturous trip up from the mall casual and compact it provides a stunning view of central parks bushy treetops and the axis of #th street at night the view dissolves into a spectacular series of overlapping images a soft curtain of light descends over the stage evoking veil like clouds of smoke two enormous glass walls one enclosing the room another the exterior of the building frame the backs of the performers lights from the cars streaming by on #th street below reflect off the glass creating a refracted pattern of blue red and gold at moments the colorful rhythms invoke mondrians broadway boogie woogie # # whose overlapping grids of line and colors captured the vibrancy of manhattans street grid but here the delicate layering of images gives the space an unexpected visual depth and you feel as if youre drifting at the citys edge the audience performers and city collapse into a single entity that connection that transparency is as meaningful from the street as it is from the seats its aim is to offer the entire city a more intimate relationship with the art form and put jazz at the center of new yorks cultural life by comparison the rose room much bigger is more self contained its oval form is surrounded by three rings of balconies clad in a dark rich wood the balconies give the room a rigid formal symmetry the stage set at one end and decorated with an arc of vertical lights anchors the room but the space can be rearranged to suit different kinds of performances sections of balcony behind the stage for example can be removed to create a more conventional proscenium stage a seating area at the back of the theater can be replaced by a more informal table arrangement mr vi olys past work has often felt cold and inhuman the brick and stucco shell of his kimmel center for the performing arts in philadelphia for example is brutal in its simplicity the rose theater has a similar geometric purity but this is the architect at his warmest the rooms proportions are perfect and the symmetry locks your attention on the performance when the lights dim everything but the stage and the elegant balconies disappears leaving you floating inside a womblike space that sense of drifting returns in dizzys club the centers most relaxed venue tables are scattered around a small stage more views open up to the city this time farther north to donald trumps sleek bronzed tower and the treetops of central park west there is something to celebrate here in engaging the city so directly mr vi olys design reasserts jazzs importance to new yorks social life yet the project suggests what is wrong with the public private partnerships so typical today that made construction of the time warner center possible situated in a maze of commercial interests the jazz center shows how contorted an effort it takes to negotiate a city where business so often comes before art the theaters are a gift but imagine what they would be if we could obliterate the banality that surrounds them architecture review
