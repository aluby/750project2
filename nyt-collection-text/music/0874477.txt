for more than a decade mysterious figures have lurked on the margins of american musical organizations especially symphony orchestras their duties may be precisely delineated or barely defined their power substantial or illusory their achievement lasting or transient though rarely seen in public they may be trotted out when their presence is useful they go by several names the most common being composer in residence the title summons the image of a composer ensconced backstage furiously churning out scores to be set before the public but what do composers in residence actually do generally they play a role in programming and advise on matters related to new music and given the atmosphere of artistic conservatism and fiscal caution that pervades most american musical institutions they perform an awkward balancing act they must mediate between their own desire to champion the new and the tendency of artistic administrators and music directors to stick with the old they must gain the trust of suspicious audiences by introducing fare that neither panders nor alienates they must argue the case for the living composer without being troublemakers as young as the breed is it is already dwindling with the start of a new concert season tania leon who was once a composer fellow of the new york philharmonic remains in the position of new music adviser and ellen taaffe zwilich begins the second year of a three year appointment to the composers chair at carnegie hall but bernard rands has left the philadelphia orchestra after a particularly long tenure of seven years as composer in residence although he continues to hold similar positions at the aspen music festival and the tanglewood music center american orchestras began to retain composers on their payrolls only in the #s new american music had become increasingly rare in orchestral programs and was often viewed as an unwelcome guest perhaps tolerated but not encouraged there were few opportunities for composers in the orchestral world and especially for younger composers said john duffy the former director of meet the composer an organization that advocates on behalf of living american composers and seeks to make them integral parts of their communities most younger composers felt that the orchestra was hopelessly out of reach so instead they wrote electronic or chamber works that was not a healthy musical situation in # meet the composer under mr duffys leadership initiated an ambitious # year plan to place composers in residence with major american orchestras and raised the money to make the idea a reality suddenly many orchestras sprouted composers some of whom played highly visible roles in new york jacob druckman worked with the philharmonic and its music director zubin mehta to develop a series of summer festivals called horizons in san francisco john adams enjoyed a warm relationship with edo de waart the symphonys music director the results included a new and unusual music series and two of mr adamss most significant orchestral works through the program composers gained a foothold in the american orchestral world and began to sense new opportunities because there were composers in residence with most major orchestras mr rands said composers in general began to feel that there was someone in the institution who advocated on their behalf someone with direct access to the music director and if one looked at programming over the last # years one would see a marked increase in the commissioning and performance of new scores in # meet the composers financing ran out the program was designed to self destruct mr duffy said if after # years the orchestra didnt have a line item in its budget for a composer then the residency would end the idea was that the orchestras would care enough to carry on the program themselves but of the # major orchestras who participated in the original residency project only # still have composers in residence some simply dropped the position when they were forced to pay for it others like the philadelphia orchestra maintained it for several years but eventually eliminated it for budgetary reasons still others like the new york philharmonic have redefined and retitled the position reducing its influence perhaps no meet the composer residency was more influential than druckmans four year stint with the philharmonic from # to # he coordinated four horizons festivals which attracted sizable audiences and called attention to a rising neo romanticism in american music druckman was succeeded by david del tredici and the philharmonic in a powerful gesture of support for new music celebrated its #th anniversary in # by commissioning # american works only # have so far been performed but mr del tredicis successor ms leon is now called new music adviser not composer in residence and the change involves more than semantics the major difference is that in the fellowship under which tania was engaged there was no promise or guarantee that works by the composer would be played or commissioned said welz kauffman the artistic administrator of the philharmonic ms leons position financed by the philharmonic includes most of the tasks composers in residence typically perform sifting through scores offering advice on repertory and taking part in public events that relate to new music it was my understanding in conversations with the management and the music director that they were in fact going to perform tanias work and that she would play a central role in advising kurt masur mr duffy said now they have an outstanding composer who has very little input ms leon discusses her role with the caution of a seasoned diplomat organizations hire composers in residence intending to find a solution yet the infrastructure of the institution is tied to a mode of operation that approaches change in a very cautious way she said as far as the nature of this residency i thought that a real partnership could be created that by uniting ideals and actions we could revive an appreciation for the contributions of our composers but it seems to me that i am a dreamer and my dreams are clouded with big ideals in any case the philharmonic has at least retained a composer on its staff in some capacity other orchestras like the philadelphia have failed to do so citing fiscal problems this is a tragedy mr rands said every orchestra can afford a composer in residence no matter what the economic situation they cannot afford not to have one it seems to me that the cost of one more back desk violinist is not relevant when compared with the broad involvement that a creative position can bring but my departure coincided with some financial crunch and in a panic response the position was eliminated joseph kluger the president of the philadelphia orchestra sees the issue in more practical terms we were facing a need to reduce expenses next year in order to balance our budget when we got together to decide which painful cuts to make we felt that this one could be made without compromising a primary objective the continued performance of contemporary music others will now divide the task of choosing which new works to perform mr kluger explained its going to require more work from our staff from our maestro wolfgang sawallisch and from our guest conductors but as one of the senior orchestras in this country we think well be able to make some kind of selection process with public and private support for musical institutions declining the orchestras decision is understandable to a financially strapped organization a composer in residence may seem an unaffordable luxury but some see other motives i am fairly skeptical about the excuse that its a financial decision said catherine wichterman the director of meet the composer the total amount spent on a composer in residence could be wiped out by the engagement of one guest artist the real issues have to do with marketing if you have a conservative board of directors a staff that doesnt specialize in contemporary music and a music director who isnt american and doesnt do much new work the elimination of the composer becomes the expedient thing to do as orchestras retrench the composer in residence will become an increasingly endangered species but a new model is offered by projects like carnegie halls composers chair ms zwilich is its first occupant and she exudes an optimism rare among orchestral composers the main reason i agreed to do this is that im considered primarily a composer and this was understood by the carnegie administration she said im not going to turn into an administrator indeed ms zwilich has been offered three major commissions all of which will receive their premieres at carnegie hall this season she will moderate making music a new series of composer conversations in weill recital hall and next season she will direct a professional training workshop for young composers but she is spared some of the problems resident composers face in orchestras the orchestra residencies are in a context where you have a music director and its a very different situation if there is a conductor who is the final authority on what music is done ms zwilich said the major role of the composer in residence is to bring contemporary music to the attention of the music director which involves wading through tons of scores i didnt feel that was right for me undoubtedly the job of composer in residence as envisioned by meet the composer could be all consuming mr druckman became so involved with horizons festivals that he missed the deadline for submission of his opera medea to the metropolitan opera which partly as a result canceled its commission no matter how idealistic the residencies may have been they often worked the proof lies in much music that would otherwise never have been written performed or recorded all the work that went into this program the foundation that was built by composers and managers and music directors is now left to wither mr duffy said without living composers the orchestras will be threadbare they may have money they may have high culture but they will lack soul classical music k robert schwarz is the author of minimalists
