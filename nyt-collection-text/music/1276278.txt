the dallas cowboys putting an end to an era of extraordinary success waived troy aikman yesterday convinced that the concussion plagued # year old quarterback who led the team to three super bowl titles could no longer remain healthy enough to be their starter aikman who has suffered # concussions in his # year career sounded yesterday like a man not prepared to retire id like to play somewhere aikman said whether thats able to work out or not i dont know theres nothing definitive aikmans agent leigh steinberg said in a telephone interview from california that aikman would take time to review his options aikman said it was a mutual and amicable decision to waive him steinberg said he and the cowboys owner jerry jones had been talking for several weeks about aikmans future and there was general recognition that the aikman era was over and that if a decision was delayed it would not afford troy the chance to at least explore what his other options were the cowboys who do not have a first round draft pick had to waive aikman by yesterday or pay him a # million bonus and extend his contract through # aikman will still count for # million against the # # million salary cap next season and that will force the cowboys to slash players from the roster to get under the cap in the end it was in the best interest for him to have a timely opportunity to entertain all of his options jones said the cowboys are left with only anthony wright who started and lost two games last season and clint stoerner who was # of # in one game last year remaining on their roster at quarterback tony banks who lost the starting job in baltimore last season has visited the cowboys dallas may also be interested in trent dilfer who wrested the job from banks and led the ravens to a super bowl title but the cowboys may not be able to afford any veterans and may have to pick up a quarterback through the draft as far as whats in the best interest of this club long term the right thing was done aikman said his final play as a cowboy ended in a concussion when he was thrown to the ground by washington linebacker lavar arrington in the first quarter of a victory over the redskins on dec # aikman is known for his powerful accuracy he was the first overall pick in the # draft and the first selection of the jones jimmy johnson regime but he has suffered four concussions in his last # starts he holds nearly every dallas passing record and has completed # # passes of # # attempts for # # yards and # touchdowns but he is coming off the worst season since the cowboys went # # when aikman was a rookie he had the lowest quarterback rating in the national football conference for a starting quarterback and more ominously he missed five games with injuries including two concussions in just # games and was knocked out of three more games all in the first quarter he twice needed epidural injections to relieve back pain he threw a career worst five interceptions against the giants last october for months there has been speculation that aikman would retire because of his frightening susceptibility to head injury which ended the career of san francisco quarterback steve young last off season and which has also cast doubt on the future of the hockey superstar eric lindros but before last season a magnetic resonance imaging indicated that aikman had suffered no lingering damage from the concussions it is unclear how aikmans history of injury will affect his opportunities with other teams although one national football league official whose team is not in need of a quarterback said he would expect teams to be cautious about aikman id be real nervous with what hes gone through the official said i think he can still play but hes getting up there and the #th one comes easier than the second but teams are so desperate for quarterbacks somebody will pick him up steinberg has been outspoken in the past about his concerns for players with concussions and it would not be a surprise if he advised aikman to retire last year young took the entire off season before he decided to walk away aikman could do the same but if he chooses to play perhaps the most likely landing spot is san diego where aikmans friend and former offensive coordinator norv turner is the offensive coordinator for the chargers the chargers have had talks with doug flutie this week and are expected to draft michael vick as the no # pick over all aikman could be brought in for the short term to groom vick steinberg called san diego yesterday afternoon to alert the chargers that aikman would be on the waiver wire aikman was one third of a brilliant triumvirate with wide receiver michael irvin and running back emmitt smith that propelled the cowboys from the leagues cellar to three super bowl titles in four years in the #s including consecutive championships in # and # irvin retired last year because of a spinal condition leaving only smith from the glory days pro football
