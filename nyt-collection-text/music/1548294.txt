most pop stars seem hellbent on convincing listeners that they mean what they sing but bette midler couldnt care less shes best known for her sentimental ballads but her current show kiss my brass is a delirious freewheeling celebration of phoniness ms midler has mastered the art of pastiche and when she performed at nassau coliseum tonight she put on a show that was both enormously entertaining and in its own cheerful way unsettling syrupy standards gave way to wisecracks and gentle antiwar slogans familiar show tunes crash landed in the middle of surreal skits ms midler constantly juxtaposed nonsense and sentiment until it became hard to tell the two apart the centerpiece of the show was fish tales ms midlers long running story of a singing mermaid with dreams of um making a splash the skit gives her a chance to roast some broadway chestnuts if youre wondering exactly how shameless she can be the words all that shad should tell you all you need to know ms midler has been performing fish tales for decades yet the skits central gag is as funny and as startling as ever squeezed into skin tight mermaid costumes ms midler and her three backup singers cant walk so they flop and crawl and drag themselves across the stage as anyone who has ever seen ms midler knows these mermaids have a secret weapon motorized wheelchairs in their chairs the mermaids became suddenly graceful and playful zooming around as if they were back in the sea the unforgettable image of four mermaids in wheelchairs hints at the complicated relationship between ability and disability between beauty and vulnerability but to her credit ms midler drew no such conclusions herself she merely made lots of piscatorial puns and moved on to the next number a few months ago she released bette midler sings the rosemary clooney songbook columbia a less than satisfying tribute album and tonights performance included a rather blank if sturdy rendition of tenderly but ms midler wisely decided not to lean too heavily on the clooney catalog by contrast another tribute was unexpectedly moving she sang a gentle song called i like to be told with an image of fred rogers the late childrens television star mister rogers projected behind her compared with his effusive partner mr rogers was deliciously inscrutable when he sang i like to be told if its going to hurt he seemed to be impersonating both a precocious child and a desperate lover but the duet also emphasized his subtle flamboyance to see his image on ms midlers stage was to notice for the first time the brightness of his cardigan the ostentatious way he changed his shoes in ms midlers world everyones a diva the show didnt shy away from current events not all of them momentous the star earned only muted applause when she joked about certain world leaders who dont explain things because they cant pronounce them and she sang a dovish ballad that asked will we keep reliving september or will we learn she sounded more defiant when chronicling another war the struggle over bette her failed cbs sitcom who loves me even though im canceled she sang and then she answered her own question nobody but the jews and so when it finally came time for the tear jerking ballads it was impossible to hear them the same way wind beneath my wings is generally interpreted as an inspirational ode to friendship but ms midler made it seem more like a witty portrait of self absorption sung by a star who thinks shes paying tribute to a friend when shes really just showing off as her voice soared higher and higher there could be no mistaking who had the wings and who was merely wind the show ended with an encore a reprise of friends ms midler noted that she has been singing this song forever but said i never meant it any more than i mean it tonight and her huge sly smile invited listeners to finish the thought or any less pop review
