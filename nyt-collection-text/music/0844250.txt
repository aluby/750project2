the removal of the iron curtain has opened up fresh territory for western music business operatives while freeing central and eastern european orchestras from a provincialism forced on them by years of communism the ride has been both exhilarating and dangerous and it has created strange bedfellows none stranger than giuseppe sinopolis directorship of the dresden staatskapelle orchestra and conductor have been here this week in two all strauss programs at carnegie hall the dresden dates its origins back to the #th century and boasts involvement in the premieres of four major strauss operas not to mention wagners tannhauser mr sinopoli has provoked rage amusement and applause for his against the grain approach to the standard repertory i remember in particular a bruckner symphony in this hall played in the manner of haydn conductorial ego is of course part of the job description but at his worst mr sinopoli has managed more or less to obliterate style and proportion in order to make his own presence felt on monday perversity took a different turn a conductor assigning to an orchestra music that he must realize his players are unable to play successfully the alpine symphony represents strauss the orchestral voluptuary the alpine is conspicuous consumption instrumental luxury stretched to the point of vulgarity the dresdens lower strings went virtually unnoticed throughout this performance the violin sections despite their earnest musicianship could offer only dry hardscrabble sonority strauss green mountain meadows reduced by drought the dresdens brass sections whaled stalwartly away and timpani climaxes banged as if in competition with everyone else no thought to balances seems to have been given no one moreover seemed to believe in this performance it had no center only a collection of orchestra sections trying to get by i wonder about the quality of the dresdens stringed instruments themselves there was often the feeling of worthwhile effort undermined not by how the musicians played but what they were playing on i dont think mr sinopoli alone could have desiccated th dresdens sound to this extent and there were indeed touching moments that rose above the obstacles in the sunset epilogue and night of the symphony for example and in the final moments of metamorphosen which began the evening the latter piece offers contemplative exteriors but seethes with inner contrapuntal complication mr sinopolis approach was light footed to begin with but i dont think all of the thinness was intentional the multiple crossing voices are terribly difficult to make clear even by a virtuoso orchestra or conductor and here clarity was a sometime thing tuesdays program included don juan the four last songs with cheryl studer and ein heldenleben music review
