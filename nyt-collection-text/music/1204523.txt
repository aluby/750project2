awards tonys # last year it was broadway # launching the tonys which the producers concede may have contributed to the misconception the first hour show is getting equal space with the cbs show on the official posters rosie odonnell who is returning as host of the overall telecast will be acting as live host of the first hour with nathan lane as co host mr lane put in a plug for the pbs hour on ms odonnells daytime talk show last tuesday a good thing since the show has been promoting the awards as this sunday on cbs at # p m its like the early part of the party he said urging viewers to tune in ms odonnell chimed in its like the cocktail party with awards ms odonnell and mr lane will open the show with a glitzy number to the tune of stephen sondheims comedy tonight it will reinforce what is true says mr folmsbee this is a three hour ceremony on two networks when that three hour broadcast begins mr folmsbee and the documentary segments producer mark mannucci will be in black tie but packed with other workers inside a control room on wheels a huge tractor trailer truck parked near radio city music hall its a cbs truck this strange dual network arrangement began in #
