This archive contains two directories, "art" and "music", containing a random
selection of stories from the _New York Times Annotated Corpus_ which were
tagged as being about, respectively, art and music.  All of these files
have the text extracted and weakly normalized (removing all punctuation,
replacing numbers by #, and convertingn to lower case) for easier
processing.
